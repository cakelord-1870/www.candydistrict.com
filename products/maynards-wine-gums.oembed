Made to resemble the taste of fine wines, although these candies contain no alcohol what so ever! In 1880, Charles Riley Maynard and his brother started making candy in their kitchen, in Stamford Hill, London. In 1896 the brothers formed the Maynard Sweet Company. Around 1900, an heir to the Maynard Company, Charles Gordon, suggested to his father they make wine gums, but Charles Riley being a strict teetotal Methodist was outraged and shocked that his son would have such a blasphemous idea!\u003c\/div\u003e\r\r\n\u003cdiv\u003eHowever, Charles finally came around to the idea of \"wine gums\" after he found out that these candies would contain no alcohol.
