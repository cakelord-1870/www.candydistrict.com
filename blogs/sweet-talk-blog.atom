      <![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span>American Verses Canadian Candy</span></h2>
<p><span>Fortunately, there are always a variety of candy choices to make in the sweet world of candy. However, there are some candies that just seem all too similar. It's almost as if they're trying to be twins! </span></p>
<div>We've made this yummy candy discovery between Canadian Candy and American Candy. 
<div>Luckily for you, we've done our delicious due diligence! We just had to taste these sweet treats in order to determine which ones come out on top!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Here are some of our candy comparisons...</div>
<div></div>
<h3>Crispy Crunch vs.Butterfinger</h3>
<div>The Crispy Crunch Canadian candy bar is so similar to the American candy bar, Butterfinger. They really are like first cousins! Each candy bar has a crunchy tasting sort of flaky peanut butter middle which is covered in a milk chocolate coating.</div>
<div>We found that the Crispy Crunch candy bar had more of a crisp bite to it, and the Butterfinger was just a little gentler of a bite, although thicker. Both taste very similar but the Crispy Crunch has both sweet and salty notes in the peanut butter confection while the Butterfinger seemed all-around sweeter. </div>
<div>The Crispy Crunch Candy Bar has been around since 1912, the Butterfinger Candy Bar came out in 1923. So we can honestly say our Canadian Candy Bar was the first! </div>
<div>We found both of these old fashioned candy bars to be delicious, but perhaps we did prefer our Canadain Crispy Crunch just a tad more! </div>
<div></div>
<h3>Maltesers vs. Whoppers</h3>
<div>Both are crispy and light chocolate-covered balls of pure sweetness, but which one pleased our discriminating candy-loving palates more? </div>
<div>Our Canadian Maltesers or the American Whoppers? Our Canadian Candy, Maltesers were first sold in 1937, and the American Candy Whoppers arrived in 1939. </div>
<div>We found that the Whoppers didn't have as thick of a chocolate covered coating and the inside seemed to be firmer in texture. Whoppers have a matt looking finish while the Maltesers were more glossy looking. </div>
<div>The Maltesers were larger in size and seemed to have a denser chocolate coating, and more of a crunchy, airy texture. Both of these old fashioned candies had that same sort of light honeycomb, malted milk taste. </div>
<div>These classic candy gems seem to be more alike than different. Although this was a tough choice, we decided that Maltesers and Whoppers are tied! We thoroughly enjoyed having to eat both of them! </div>
<div></div>
<h3>Smarties vs. Smarties</h3>
<div>In this case our Canadian candy, Smarties are vastly different then the American version of Smarties Candy. Could there even be a dispute on which Smarties are better? This is like comparing apples to oranges, but here we go anyways!</div>
<div>Our Canadian Smarties are round, brightly coloured candy-coated shells with milk chocolate inside. Smarties Candy has a slight crunch and a creamy middle, and of course, we eat the red ones last! Always a delicious retro candy that makes for a tasty afternoon pick me up!</div>
<div>American Smarties include no chocolate! These candies are a tablet-like candy that comes in a roll. These Smarties come in hues of pretty pastel colours like, yellow, pink, purple, orange and green. Each colour has a slightly different taste. These American candies are crunchy, some might say tangy and sweet. These candies are what we call "Rockets" here in Canada.</div>
<div>Which is better?  Well according to our tastebuds, the Canadian Candy Smarties wins! </div>
<div></div>
<h3>Heath vs. Skor</h3>
<div>These two candy bars are very close in the main idea of what the bar consists of and they do visually appear similar, but upon the sweet consumption of these two Candy Bars, there are notable differences. </div>
<div>The Heath Candy Bar is an American classic! Coming out in 1928, made with a crunchy middle of English Toffee that is covered in Hersheys Milk Chocolate. This American Candy Bar has a sweet, nut-like taste, and is also used to crush up and put on top of ice cream or desserts for a yummy finishing touch! It is a delectable tasting treat!</div>
<div>Our Canadian Candy Bar, the Skor Bar is also filled with a thin slab of crunchy toffee and coated with a layer of delicious milk chocolate. This Canadian Candy Bar seems to have more of a buttery taste to it along with a nutty flavour as well. In the Skor Candy Bar, you have both a sweet and mild salty taste which only adds to the depth of flavour. Coming out in 1981, we Canadians have loved this retro candy bar for decades! The Skor Candy Bar can also be used crushed up to use as a  topping for cakes, cupcakes and ice cream. </div>
<div>This is a close call! The American Candy Bar is just as delicious as the Canadian Candy Bar. This is a tough one, even for Candy Boss! </div>
<div>After many delicious and crunchy bites, we have to say the American Heath Candy Bar wins this one! </div>
<div></div>
<h3>Rasinettes vs. Glossettes</h3>
<div>We're sure that these two candies are long lost, cousins! The American Candy, Raisinettes and our Canadian Candy Glosettes both consist of real raisins that are covered in delicious milk chocolate! </div>
<div>Opening the boxes they both look almost identical, the only difference is the shine factor, the Glosettes actually look glossy and the Rasinettes look more matte. Both appear to be the same size which is a mix of some smaller raisins and some larger ones.</div>
<div>Tasting the Glosettes Raisins Candy we noticed that the taste of the raisins was still apparent through the chocolate coating. They were chewy and both the raisins and chocolate tasted amazing! Glosettes raisins really are a great tasting Canadian candy! </div>
<div>The Rasinettes were a little more firm and the chocolate and the raisins were a tangy tasting. The texture wasn't as chewy as the Glosettes and overall this American Candy just didn't seem to impress us as the Glosettes Raisins did!</div>
<div>For this sweet showdown, we just have to choose our classic Canadian candy, Glosettes!</div>
<div></div>
<h3>Milky Way vs. Mars</h3>
<div>We must admit, both of these Candy Bars are out of this world delicious! They are very close in appearance and also taste, but which one wins? </div>
<div>Candy Boss and I first start with the American Candy Bar, Milky Way. This is a thick and dense bar. Inside is a layer of yummy caramel and fluffy nougat, that is covered in a layer of milk chocolate. The ratio of caramel and nougat was great, the caramel is on the thicker side so you could actually taste it. The chocolate is a firm layer that did crumble a little at each bite. </div>
<div>The Milky Way Candy bar is an old fashioned American bar that came out in 1923. It has proven itself to be a delicious tasting candy bar with lots of textures, it certainly does hit the sweet spot!</div>
<div>Moving on to our Canadian Candy Bar, The Mars Bar. This candy bar made it's way to Canada from the UK in 1940 and remains a top-selling Canadain candy Bar choice. This bar also has caramel and nougat filling with a milk chocolate coating. It's about the same size as the Milky Way and they look very similar. The layer of milk chocolate does have a better taste than the Milky Way, and the caramel really does spill out on your lips like a silky, golden strand of ribbon! The nougat is very light, and fluffy with a nice and airy consistency when compared to the American Candy Bar. Our Canadian Mars Bar is just as delectable as ever! It really is a light-textured bar, and very satisfying in its flavours!</div>
<div>In this candy case, we crown the Mars Bar the winner! </div>
<div>While the Milky Way Bar is a great tasting bar, it just doesn't seem to have that same quality or texture as the Mars Candy Bar does. The Mars Candy Bar really nails each element perfectly, it's light, satisfying and irresistible! Our Canadian Mars Candy Bar is the clear winner here!</div>
<h3>All the Candy was good!</h3>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>All of these Candies were a close call! Each has its own sweet lure, after all, this was based on our Canadian Candy tastebuds! It does seem that in our Candy Showdown our Canadian candies came out victorious! Don't get us wrong though, we love all candy! Let us know what you think, do you agree or disagree? </div>
<div>Have your own taste test</div>

    <title>Are All Cadbury Bars Created Equally?</title>

      <![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Who Makes the Best Cadbury Bars?</h2>
<div>No matter where you are in the world, one would imagine that just a glance at a shiny Cadbury Chocolate wrapper would seem to induce a sweet and velvety memory of rich, delicious and unrivalled chocolate. Except, upon tasting an American Cadbury Bar we noticed that it tasted vastly different than ours.</div>
<div>Americans must wonder why their Cadbury Chocolate Bars just don't seem to taste as exquisitely dreamy as our Canadain Cadbury Bars. We just had to figure this one out, are Cadbury Chocolate bars not created equally? </div>
<div>According to Chocolate enthusiasts and connoisseurs, Americans get the short end of the stick when it comes to Cadbury Chocolate. But don't worry, we're here to help rescue any Cadbury craving!</div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Hershey's acquires Cadbury Brand in the USA </h3>
<div>It all began in 1988 when the Hershey Company acquired a license to sell and also make Cadbury products in the USA. This means that Hershey's idea of what chocolate is can be sold as Cadbury. This includes a large variety of what we know and love in Canada as Cadbury products like, Dairy Milk Chocolate Bars, Creme Eggs and even the Mini Eggs. But there's a very big difference in the flavour and some might say the quality.</div>
<div>While the exact difference may not be tasted by an American born Chocolate eater, it would seem to be very apparent for us here in Canada and also of course in its birthplace, the UK.</div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Hershey's is America's Leading Chocolate Manufacturer</h3>
<div>Most Americans do seem to have a special liking to Hershey chocolate, and who can blame them. I'm sure it tastes of those divine childhood chocolate memories. Filled with sweet Hershey's Kisses and bright orange packages of peanut butter cups. The popularity of Hershey Chocolate seems to be unmatched. It is America's leading chocolate manufacturer and has been since 1894. With $7.4 billion annually in sales worldwide, Hershey's ain't going anywhere! I'm sure, it's what an Americanized chocolate dream tastes like to many.</div>
<div>Having said that, there are many American chocolate bars that I could</div>
<div>never imagine having to do without. The thought of a life without any Reeses Peanut Butter Cups, Almond Joy, or those sweet and lovely morsels</div>
<div>of Hershey's kisses- I would be devastated! Really.</div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Chocolate made with mainly milk vs. sugar</h3>
<div>The US version of Cadbury is made in Hazelton, Pennsylvania. Many chocolate lovers and hardcore UK Cadbury lovers claim that the American version of Cadbury just doesn't seem to make the chocolate cut. Finding it much sweeter than the original British version, grainier and darker in colour. This makes sense because the first ingredient in British Cadbury milk chocolate is milk, in an American Cadbury milk chocolate, it's sugar.</div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Original Cadbury Bars are banned in the USA</h3>
<div>It's also very interesting to note that in 2015 Hershey's actually took legal action banning US imports from Cadbury from entering the country. Americans can only buy American made Cadbury products! Is that really any consolation? What is a real Cadbury fanatic to do?</div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Does Canada make the best Cadbury Bars?</h3>
<div>Here in Canada, our Cadbury Chocolate will definitely fill in the tasteful and delicious gaps. Cadbury chocolate is made right here in Ontario, at 277 Gladstone Ave. Toronto. This factory truly is the epitome of what chocolate should taste like! This is no sugar-induced dream, my friends,  it's real unadulterated, delectable chocolate!</div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">We have sweet proof.</h3>
<div>Our friends at <a href="https://www.canadianliving.com/food/article/makes-best-dairy-milk-chocolate-bar" target="_blank" title="Canada Living" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Canadian Living</strong> </a>once visited this spectacular place, the proof is in the pudding! (or chocolate in this case!) Our Cadbury Chocolate does win! </div>
<div>Because of our kindness, manners and generosity as Canadians, we don't mind sharing with you at all. We want you to taste the real and authentic flavour of what Cadbury Chocolate is really all about. </div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Which Country Makes your Favourite Cadbury Bars</h3>
<div>What do you think? Can you taste a difference, or do you find them similar?</div>]]>

      <![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Sweet Nostalgic Candy from the 90s</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/top-10-nostalgic-candies-from-the-1990s-candy-district-sweetest-online-candy-store-canada.png?v=1545783106" alt="Top 10 Nostalgic Candies from the 1990's-Candy District"></p>
<div>The world of the1990s was a stark contrast to the earlier decades. Any remnants of the "simpler days" were now long gone. The technology was growing by leaps and bounds, and computers were becoming essential. In 1991, the World Wide Web became available to the public. The whole world became fascinated, curious and afraid with the impending doom of the new millennium on the horizon. " Y2K Hysteria" was real (we live to tell) We became a very intrigued group of people with cell phones, computers and the internet. </div>
<div> It became fashionable to have the "grunge" look, which basically meant looking unkempt and like you just rolled out of bed. The days of glamour were clearly gone. There was lots of denim and unbuttoned flannel shirts, and wearing work boots was in vogue. The 1990's era is sometimes called the "anti-fashion" decade. </div>
<div>We all met "Forrest Gump", and we cheered him on as he ran. We fell in love aboard the ill-fated "Titanic" as Jack and Rose heart-wrenchingly defined star-crossed lovers. We met our  New York "Friends" at the Central Perk and bemoaned life. We sat on the edge of our seats and questioned the existence of aliens with Mulder and Scully.</div>
<div> We listened to MC Hammer, Vanilla Ice and Nirvana, probably on our Discmans.</div>
<div>There was Rap, Hip Hop, Grunge and Alternative Rock. We heard the repetitive and digital sounds of Techno.</div>
<div>Among all of the changes in the world, and on the verge of a new millennium, there was still a sweet escape to be had, Candy. </div>
<div></div>
<h3><strong>Here are our Top 10 Retro Candies of The 1990s...</strong></h3>

      <![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">1980's candy was totally gnarly</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/top-10-retro-candies-from-the-1980s-candy-district-online-candy-store-canada.png?v=1543721610" alt="Top 10 Retro Candies from the 1980's"></p>
<div>The 1980's, when everything was so blindingly bright. Neon colours became a cool statement. The fashion seemed completely absurd, to say the least, and the music was made up of overly digitalized sounds. Commercialism was at an all-time high, pop culture was exploding, and the money was abundantly flowing.</div>
<div>We began to imagine a distant future, as Micheal J. Fox took us on a time-warped journey, in "Back To The Future."  While every kid on the block was trying to kick as high as Ralph Macchio and dreamed of a sensei with the wisdom of Mr. Myagi. We met the most gentle extraterrestrial, and a whole nation becomes fixated as E.T. rides a bicycle through the sky with his new best friend Elliot.</div>
<div>Michael Jackson danced and sang across stages worldwide, teaching us the moonwalk. We begin to hear the first sounds of rap music and tried to memorize every word of "Rapper's Delight". Cyndi Lauper explained that "Girls Just Want To Have Fun" and Tina Turner asked us "What's Love Got To Do With It". While MTV taught us much more than we needed to know.</div>
<div>We wished for the A-Team to have our backs, and we needed Macguyver to get us out of trouble. We wanted our Grandmothers to have the spunkiness of the Golden Girls, and we dreamed of cheesy romances that sparked aboard the "Love Boat".</div>
<div>The Valley girls wore bright neon spandex while they rushed to their jazzercise classes. Some of us fell victim to sweatbands and scrunchies and wore plastic bracelets up our arms.  Parachute pants were sought after, and every girl wore electric blue mascara with ridiculously oversized shoulder pads.</div>
<div>Everything was different now, the '70s seemed like a distant dream. We discovered the addictiveness of Pac-Man, and spend countless hours with the colourful challenge of the Rubix cube, which perplexed many. But among all the inevitable changes in the world, there were delicious candy discoveries to be found, and of course some "totally Radical" new candies!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Here are our Top 10 Retro Candies from the 1980s...</div>
<div></div>
<h3>#1. <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/collections/airheads-candy" target="_blank" title="Airheads Candy" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airheads Candy</a>
</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/airheads-candy-top-10-retro-candies-from-the-1980s-candy-district.png?v=1543714883" alt="Airheads Candy-Top 10 Retro Candies from the 1980's-Candy District"></p>
<div>Airheads candy is a taffy-like, chewy, fruity taste of pure awesomeness! This retro confection came out in 1985, it was thought of by Steve Bruner who worked for Perfetti Van Melle. The name  Airheads were thought of one night when Bruner approached his three sons and asked them "What do you call your friends when they do something silly?" Finally one of his sons yelled out "Airhead". Steve Bruner thought it was perfect, the name was set. Airheads Candy started out with just one red flavour, now there are over 17!

<div>This retro, delectable candy bar first came out in 1981. The Skor Bar is a thin and crisp chocolate bar made of brittle butter toffee, coated in milk chocolate. It's a retro candy bar that is worth savouring. The Skor Candy Bar is made by Hershey's. Originally this candy bar came out to compete against the "Heath" candy bar, (the Skor bar's twin) but since Hershey's has now acquired the Heath candy bar, there really is no competition. </div>
<div>These bars are almost identical, there are subtle if any differences between them. The Skor Candy Bar has a more buttery and stronger tasting toffee, the Heath Candy bar's toffee is lighter in colour and more nutty tasting. Both, covered in milk chocolate. These two candy bars tie, they are neck and neck in terms of deliciousness. But to be honest, I think Skor offers a better tasting toffee! If you really want to Skor, you need the Skor Candy Bar!</div>

The Twix Candy Bar contains two bars of a butter cookie center that is topped with creamy caramel while being completely smothered in rich milk chocolate. It quickly became a candy bar favourite in its shiny gold packaging and retro looking orange letters.

This retro candy bar is already enticing as it offers us two twin bars, making it convenient to save some for later or share with a friend. (As if! We both know you are going to eat both)</div>
<div>There were some variations of the Twix Bar in 1989 when the manufacturer, Mars Inc., decided to replace that luscious caramel with a creamy peanut butter. This proved to be not as popular and this peanut butter twist of a Twix bar was soon discontinued. But, there are whispers that it could soon reappear on the market.</div>
<div>The Twix candy bar always hits the spot, great for that afternoon lull or anytime the craving strikes. This delicious bar is full of exquisite crunch and so pleasing with its perfect chocolate and caramel taste. One of the best and most popular candy bars to come out of the 1980's!</div>

<div>The 1970's were an intense time. The start of new attitudes from the 1960's grew even stronger throughout the 1970's decade. The fight for equality continued, there were urban riots and anti-war protests. The hippies continued their plight of "free love", while the cold war got colder.</div>
<div>The Beatles announced their split, while Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven" topped the charts. Mary Tyler Moore gave us a glimpse into being an independent, career woman, and Gene Wilder ran a chocolate factory as <a href="https://www.roalddahl.com/roald-dahl/characters/grown-ups/willy-wonka" target="_blank" title="Willy Wonka" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Willy Wonka</strong></a>.</div>
<div>The Eagles took us to "Hotel California" and John Travolta serenaded us on the big screen with "Grease". ABBA made us believe we could all be  "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFrGuyw1V8s" target="_blank" title="Dancing Queens" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Dancing Queens</strong></a>", and <a href="http://www.pinkfloyd.com/" target="_blank" title="Pink Floyd" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Pink Floyd</strong></a> informed us about being "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpFo_E9Fq2k" target="_blank" title="Comfortably Numb" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Comfortably Numb</strong></a>".</div>
<div>The silver screen met the intensity of a feared mob boss as Marlon Brando played "The Godfather". JJ gave us "Good Times", <a href="http://brucespringsteen.net/" target="_blank" title="Bruce Springsteen" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Bruce Springsteen</strong></a> informed us that we were "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxuThNgl3YA" target="_blank" title="Born To Run" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Born To Run</strong></a>",  while Marvin Gaye begged to know, "What's Going On"</div>
<div>Among all the platform shoes, butterfly collars and loud patterns, brightly coloured polyester was the fabric of choice. There were micro mini's, skin-tight pants, bell bottoms, and an abundance of chest hair that featured larger than life gold medallions. Men grew enormous sideburns, while woman began to frequently wear pants. It all made a statement, it was funky, fresh and fun. </div>
<div>While the world went through its brave new changes, there was plenty of sugar rushes to be had with all of the delicious and enticing retro candy of the 1970's.</div>

<div>This retro candy has let us make a real fashion statement over the years! Ring Pop lollipops are the sweet candy jewel that we love to wear and eat! Ring Pop first came out in 1979 and was the brainchild of Frank Richards. Frank had a reason in mind when he came up with this candy. Frank's young daughter had the bad habit of sucking her thumb and he thought that maybe his Ring Pop candy could curb the habit. It did just that, and in the meantime, people became enamoured with this sweet bling of a candy ring. Ring Pop Candy is made by Topps, and come in a variety of 5 fun flavours, so you can wear one Ring Pop on every finger and really make a statement!  Ring Pop Candy comes in Raspberry Lemonade, Berry Blast, Watermelon, Blue Raspberry and Strawberry. Why not be bold?  Add some 70's flair to your outfit with these funky and sweet Ring Pop lollipops!</div>

<div>Bottle Caps are a memorable retro candy, that comes in a tablet form, and are made to look like a metal soda bottle cap. These retro candies are a combination of a sweet and slightly tart taste. Bottle Caps candy is made to resemble your favourite fizzy soda drink. Bottle Caps come in a roll of exceptional flavours. There are Cherry, Root Beer, Cola and Grape flavours. Upon their arrival to the candy world in 1972, they were a hit with consumers. The timing was perfect as it coincided with the 1971 film, Willy Wonka And The  Chocolate Factory. It made us believe in the sweet power of candy, and we the audience, could taste it too! </div>

<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/pop-rocks-top-10-retro-candies-from-the-1970s-candy-district.png?v=1538963331" alt="Pop Rocks Candy-Top 10 Retro Candies from the 1970's"></p>
<div>This explosive retro candy popped onto the scene in 1975. Invented by food chemist, William Mitchell. Pop Rocks Candy has had many copycat candies over the years, but none come close to the likes of the original popping candy, Pop Rocks. These retro candies are thrilling, as they pop and explode in your mouth. You can not only taste their carbonated quality but feel it too! Pop Rocks became the cool new candy around. They flew off the shelves and everybody and their brother had to try them. This went on until 1983 when the big rumour about Mikey from the Life cereal commercials began to spread. The rumour was that Mikey's stomach had exploded while eating Pop Rocks and drinking his favourite soda. This was not true, and Pop Rocks even set up a hotline to assure concerned and paranoid parents that this was not the case. After much controversy Pop Rocks finally came back to the candy world, and once again we could eagerly taste these delicious, popping morsels of exploding goodness. Those of us who were brave also tried to tempt fate and test out that old "Mikey rumour". We drank soda and ate Pop Rocks at the same, and we live to tell! Perhaps the rumour enticed us even more and only heightened the Pop Rocks candy experience. For that brave and bold 70's candy lover in you, Pop Rocks are a true blast from the past! Go ahead and taste the explosion!</div>

<p> </p>
<div>This well-loved retro candy was introduced in 1978. Reese's Pieces Candy became an even bigger hit in 1982 when our adorable alien friend E.T. took a liking to them. Reeses' Pieces is a Hershey Candy that was originally thought of in order to capitalize on the sweet success of the famed Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. Reese's Pieces are a delightful peanut-buttery smooth middle, that is surrounded by a thin and crunchy candy shell. The brown, orange and yellow mixture that makeup Reese's Pieces almost went by a different name. Originally they were going to be called PB's. </div>
<div>The company claims that upon their release they were a hit with consumers but then saw their sales slowly decline until that is, E.T. saved the day! Making Reese's Pieces Candy more popular than ever! This candy has expanded and ventured out of its usual form. Reese's Pieces can now be found inside of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, together making the Reese's Big Cups. A dynamic and delicious combination that has won over tons of delighted taste buds!</div>

The Everlasting Gobstopper was originally made by Breaker Confections before becoming acquired by the Nestle Brand and based on the book by Roald Dahl, and the 1971 film Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. The Everlasting Gobstopper is fashioned like a jawbreaker but with a few creative tweaks. Made of layer upon layer of changing colours and flavours, after 42 years it's still an astonishing and phenomenal retro candy!

<div>Sour Patch Kids were born in the late 1970's. This retro candy was invented right here in Ontario, Canada! Originally thought of by Frank Galatolie, and were based on another product of his called "Mars Men". These cute little chewy candies were originally shaped as Martians until the cute looking kid factor won over. When the candy was changed to the "Sour Patch Kids" name they benefitted greatly by capitalizing on the Cabbage Patch Dolls craze. These sweet and sour retro candies didn't make it to the USA until 1985, and when they did, they were all the rage!  Sour Patch Kids Candy were originally made by the M&amp;A Candy Company but have since been acquired by Maynards Candy. These sweet than sour, retro candies have delighted us for years now. The fact that they are so darn cute makes the Sour Patch Kids that much harder to resist!</div>

<div>No one really knows the exact time when Jelly Beans were invented. But we do know about this retro jelly bean! Jelly Belly is the world's most famous and well-loved gourmet jelly beans. Along with their endless colours and flavours, it's no wonder! Jelly Belly was introduced in 1976 and had eight original flavours, Very Cherry, Root Beer, Cream Soda, Tangerine, Green Apple, Lemon, Licorice and Grape. They first started off as a part of the Goelitz Confectionery Company before creating this very special brand of jelly beans. When these intense tasting jelly beans first launched their response was unbelievable! Inevitably more flavours were added to the Jelly Belly Collection. In 1981, the Blueberry Jelly Bean was created out of Ronald Regan's love for them. Jelly Belly shipped 3.5 tons to Washington D.C. for Regan's inauguration. Jelly Belly has grown tremendously since it started in 1976. There are 50 flavours of gourmet jelly beans to be had. Some are even made with all natural ingredients and real fruit juices, and some, if you've ever heard of "<a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/bean-boozled-jelly-belly" target="_blank" title="Bean Boozled" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Bean Boozled</strong></a>", are just downright nasty tasting! From Very Cherry flavour to Rotten Egg flavour, Jelly Belly has extensive and exquisite flavours,(not including the Jelly Belly Beanboozled ). Not since 1976 has a jelly bean been so delicious!</div>

<h3>#10. Zotz Candy</h3>

<div>This retro candy packs a surprise! Zotz candy is intriguing, with it's secret and intense fizzy powder that is concealed in its hard candy shell. There was always something compelling about these hard little retro candies. The fizzy powder contained inside is surely enough to make your eyes water. If you crunch them fast, they will suddenly erupt, and you're left with a volcanic explosion of a sour, tart and zinginess flavour that is unique to only Zotz Candy. On the other hand, if you let them dissolve slowly, you get a slow seeping, fizzing experience.</div>
<div>Zotz Candy first originated in Italy and was made by G.B Ambrosoli, until being distributed to North America in 1970, by <a href="https://andreprost.com/" target="_blank" title="Andre Post Inc" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Andre Post Inc</strong></a>. The Zotz Candy comes in Cherry, Apple, Watermelon, Blue Raspberry, Orange, Grape and have recently added Strawberry to the mix. The slogan for this candy is perfectly fitting</div>
<div>"Where The Fizz Izz!". With their fizzy eruption of flavourful sourness, the retro candy called Zotz stands out as one of the 1970's best candies!</div>

<div>There were many ups and downs during the 1960's decade. The Vietnam War was in motion, and civil rights protests were a common occurrence. A social rebellion was on the agenda for many, and we began to see the start of the "Free Love" movement take place.</div>
<div>Johnny Carson became an entertaining nighttime ritual, and Muhammad Ali became the Worlds Heavyweight Champion. The echo of Martin Luther Kings speech "I have a dream" was in everyone's ear, while the Rolling Stones blasted on the radio. </div>
<div>The Supremes reminded us not to hurry love, while the first James Bond movie played on movie screens across the nation. A man landed on the moon (or did he?) In the meantime, four young men from England introduced themselves as the Beatles, taking the world by storm!</div>
<div>There were Greasers, Mods and hippies, and there was tons of sweet candy to be had!</div>
<div></div>
<h3>Here are our Top 10 Retro Candies Of The 1960's...</h3>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<h3>#1. <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/razzles-original" target="_blank" title="Razzles" rel="noopener noreferrer">Razzles</a>
</h3>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/razzles-retro-candy-top-10-candies-from-the-1960s-candy-district.png?v=1537106283" alt="Razzles Candy-Top 10 Retro Candies from the 1960's"></p>
<div>This retro candy gives us the best of both worlds! "First it's a candy, then it's a gum. Little round Razzles are so much fun". Razzles were introduced in 1966. They start off as a candy but upon chewing them they transform into a gum. When Razzles were first created they were made by the Fleer Company until finally in 2004, they were acquired by Concord Confections. Razzles, with their unique hybrid ability, was the very first candy in the world that was able to change forms! Originally, Razzles only came in one flavour, Raspberry. Eventually, the flavours expanded into Razzles Tropical, Razzles Sour and Razzles Fizzles. Over the years Razzles Candy has remained an interesting form of candy. This flavourful, morphing candy has only gained new fans over the years and has never lost its interesting appeal. </div>

<h3>#2. <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/maynards-swedish-fish" target="_blank" title="Swedish Fish Candy" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swedish Fish Candy</a>
</h3>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/maynards-swedish-fish-retro-candy-top-10-candies-from-the-1960s-candy-district.png?v=1537107518" alt="Maynards Swedish Fish Retro Candy-Top 10 Candies from the 1960's"></p>
<div>These sweet little chewy fish have been caught in more mouths than we can count! The retro Swedish Fish candy first made their appearance in North America in the early 1960's. The candy originated in Sweden and was first made by the Malaco Candy Company. The Malaco Company wanted to introduce these delicious fish to the world so they struck up a deal with Cadbury Adams Company,  which is now Mondelez. Swedish Fish are made by Maynards Candy and the Malaco Company still makes them in Sweden. Swedish Fish are a chewy candy and most popular among them are their original red colour, which is a sweet berry flavour. Some say it's a raspberry flavour, others speculate it's of lingonberry flavour. The flavours of Swedish Fish since the 1960's have expanded to include an assortment of other fruity flavours. Swedish Fish have once found their way into a 2016, limited edition flavour of Oreo Cookies. They have also swum their way into an exceptional flavour of Trident Gum, as Swedish Fish and Lemon flavour. The Swedish Fish of the 1960's remain a sweet candy catch!</div>
<div></div>
<h3>#3.<a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/lemon-head-candy" target="_blank" title="Lemon-Head Candy" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lemon-Head Candy</a>
</h3>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/lemon-head-retro-candy-top-10-candies-from-the-1960s-candy-district.png?v=1537107909" alt="Lemon-Head Candy-Top 10 Retro Candies from the 1960's"></p>
<span>Lemon-Head Candy is a tangy retro candy that was created in 1962. These yellow candies are made by the <a href="http://www.ferrarausa.com/" target="_blank" title="Ferrara Candy Company" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Ferrara Candy Company</strong></a>, the same makers of the <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/atomic-fireball-candy" target="_blank" title="Atomic Fireball" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Atomic Fireball</strong></a>, Boston Baked Beans and Red Hots. This company are experts at the cold panned candy process, which is layers and layers of candy that is a labour intensive process that can take up to 14 days to make! Lemon-Head are a fresh and tangy taste of lemon, with a sweet outside coating and an intensely lemon flavoured hard candy core. Lemon-Head Candy does have quite a bite to them! The inventor of Lemon-Head Candy was Nello Ferrara who said that his inspiration came from the birth of his son, Salvatore, who claimed he had a head that was shaped just like a lemon. So along with his son Salvatore Ferrara, Lemon-Head candy was born! </span>
<div></div>
<h3>#4. Now And Later Candy</h3>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/now-and-later-fruit-chews-retro-candy-top-10-candies-from-the-1960s-candy-district.png?v=1537112058" alt="Now and Later Fruit Chews Retro Candy-Top 10 Candies from the 1960's"></p>
<div>The Now And Later retro candy came to us from Brooklyn, New York in 1962. They are fruity flavoured taffy-like candies are intense and bright tasting, tangy and incredibly tasty. Now And Later candy was first made by the Phoenix Candy Company. The original flavours were red, blue and green. Over the years the flavours of these retro candies have greatly expanded. Some of their most notable and popular flavours included Thriller, Rainbow and Blue Jeans. The Now And Later candies now come in 12 fruity flavours, Apple, Banana, Blue Raspberry, Cherry/Apple Splits, Cherry, Grape, Strawberry, Tropical Lemonade, Tropical Punch, Watermelon, Wild Fruits and the Original. The Now And Later retro candy are now made by the Ferrara Candy Company, and as we all know they are no longer five cents! Their name was meant to imply that you could eat some now and then save some for later. But we doubt that you can actually save any of these delicious, malleable taffy, candies. You will probably eat them all now!</div>
<div></div>
<h3>#5. <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/wonka-sweetarts-roll" target="_blank" title="Sweetarts Candy" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweetarts Candy</a>
</h3>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/wonka-sweetarts-retro-candy-top-10-candies-from-the-1960s-candy-district.png?v=1537112507" alt="Wonka Sweetarts-Top 10 Retro Candies from the 1960's"></p>
<div>This retro candy is sweet and sour with a punch of delicious tanginess! Sweetarts Candy was invented in 1963 and was produced by the Sunline Candy Company. Sweetarts came in the exciting flavours of Cherry, Lemon, Lime, Orange and Grape. In 1964 a nationwide campaign was formed for Sweetarts Candy and as a result, 8 Million dollars worth of Sweetarts Candy were sold! The Sweetarts Candy is based on Pixy Stix retro candy, as it was thought consumers would rather a condensed tablet like candy rather than a loose powdered. For many of us candy lovers, Sweetarts Candy brings to mind one of our favourite characters, Willy Wonka. But I suppose that all depends on your age and when you first tried Sweetarts. Today, Nestles produces Sweetarts Candy and there are many forms available, such as Giant Sweetarts, Chewy Sweetarts and Mini Sweetarts. This candy lives on. Sweetarts Candy remains one of the most popular retro candies today!</div>
<div></div>
<h3>#6.Astro Pop </h3>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/astro-pop-retro-candy-top-10-candies-from-the-1960s-candy-district.png?v=1537112782" alt="Astro Pop-Top 10 Retro Candies from the 1960's"></p>
<div>A favourite retro candy, a unique and triple coloured lollipop, the Astro Pop was invented in 1963. It was actually developed by two rocket scientists, who decided to quit their jobs and focus on creating this unique lollipop. Obviously, their inspiration was close to their hearts, as the Astro Pop Lollipop was designed after a three-stage rocket. During the 1960's, the "Space Race", as they refer to it, was in full force and many capitalized on its intriguing mystery. This proved to be perfect timing for the famous Astro Pop. Quitting their day jobs certainly paid off as it became a wildly, sought after and popular lollipop at the time. Astro Pop is actually made and moulded in the wrapper. The hot liquid candy is poured into the wrapper, a.stick is inserted and it's finished off with a layer of wax.  Once made by Spangler, Astro Pop is now produced by <a href="https://leafbrands.com/" target="_blank" title="Leaf Brands" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Leaf Brands</strong></a>. The original three flavours of the Astro Pop were Pineapple, Passionfruit and Cherry. These unforgettable retro lollipops now come in Banana Split and Caramel Apple. The retro Astro Pops Lollipops are deliciously out of this world. They've blasted our taste buds since the 1960's!</div>

<div>This deluxe tasting candy bar was first made in 1966. The 100 Grand Bar with its decadent combination of chocolate, crisped rice bits and chewy caramel is a rich and satisfying retro candy bar. The 100 Grand Bar as we know it today was originally called the "Hundred Thousand Dollar Bar". This retro candy bar was created by Nestle and was based on a variety of popular game shows at the time. The slogan for this bar has been used since it's release in1966 and it's perfectly fitting at "That's Rich". The lure of the 100 Grand Bar, besides its flavoursome ingredients, is that this American Candy Bar has 30% less fat than the average candy bar. At a mere 210 calories, it really is "Rich".</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<h3>#8.Starburst Candy</h3>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/starburst-original-fruit-chews-retro-candy-top-10-candies-from-the-1960s-candy-district.png?v=1537113259" alt="Starburst Original Fruit Chews-Top 10 Retro Candies from the 1960's"></p>
<div>"Unexplainably Juicy" is the famous slogan for this retro candy, a perfect description for the Starburst Candy! These chewy and fruity morsels of goodness first arrived in England in 1960. At that time they went by a different name, "Opal Fruits". Eventually, this candy would come across the pond, and upon their arrival in North America in 1967, they decided to call them Starburst. A much more memorable and catchy name! The original flavours of Starburst Candy were Strawberry, Orange, Lemon and Lime. The flavours remained exactly the same until they expanded their plethora of delicious fruity flavours in 1984 Including an all Strawberry Starbursts flavour, to Sour only Starbursts, also Gummibursts, Sweet Fiesta Starburst, Sweet Heat Starbursts, and the transformational Flavourmorph, which has two flavours in one candy. Starbursts retro candy has always been loved for its triumph of tasty and intense chewy flavours. Starburst retro candy is one of the most popular chewy candies to this day. Upon unwrapping one you will taste their "Unexplainably Juicy" and innovative, delicious flavours!</div>

<div>Our chocolate love affair with this luscious Canadain Chocolate Bars started way back in 1968. This retro candy bar originated in Birmingham England before sweetly making its way here to North America. This divine tasting Canadian Chocolate Bar is made right here in Toronto, Ontario on 277 Gladstone Ave. The factory has satisfied all of our indulgent chocolate cravings long before the 1960's, and it all started here in 1906. We have always wondered and pondered the mystery of the Caramilk Candy Bar. The question being, just how do they get that caramel inside? Some of the best things in life are better off left alone, after all,  we all love a sweet secret. In the meantime, we'll stay curious and keep eating the delicious, retro Carmilk Candy Bar and see if we come up with any ideas. Since 1968, the Caramilk Candy Bar has satisfied us with its smooth and silky caramel and extraordinary chocolate.</div>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/top-10-candies-from-the-1950s-candy-decades.png?v=1536492237" alt="Top 10 Retro Candies from the 1950's"></p>
<div>The simpler time of the 1950's, it's sweet nostalgia still seems to beckon us. An idyllic time when life seemed much less complicated. The Great Depression was becoming a faint memory, and the economy seemed to be on the upswing. Poodle skirts and penny loafers were in vogue, and Howdy Doody was playing on television sets, in pastel coloured living rooms across the neighbourhood. Milk was delivered right to your door, and weekends at the cinema's afternoon matinees were a popular pastime. Rock n' Roll was the sound of Saturday nights. "Crazy" new music as far as parents were concerned, and every doe-eyed, wholesome teenage girl was in love with <a href="http://www.elvis.com/" target="_blank" title="Elvis Presley" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Elvis Presley</strong></a>. The world had a new rhythm and some sweet new candy!</div>
<div></div>
<h3>Here are our Top 10 Candies from the 1950's...</h3>
<h3>#1. <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/pixy-stix" target="_blank" title="Pixy Stix Candy" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pixy Stix Candy</a>
</h3>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/pixy-stik-willy-wonka-candy-top-10-candies-from-the-1950s-candy-district.png?v=1536447331" alt="Pixy Stix Candy-Top 10 Candies from the 1950's"></p>
<div>A unique and flavoursome powdered, retro candy inside of a straw-like shape. Invented in 1952, in St.Lois, Missouri. It was originally made by Sunline Incorporated. This old fashioned candy started out as a mix for drinks and went by the name of Frutola. When the maker of "Frutola" discovered that people were just eating the powder instead of mixing it with water, they decided to market this yummy powder as a candy. The Pixy Stix retro candy gives meaning to the term "Sugar Rush", especially the ones that are almost two feet long! Pixy Stix Candy is now made by <a href="http://www.ferrarausa.com/" target="_blank" title="Ferrara Candy" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Ferrara Candy</strong></a>, but will forever be known in most of our minds as a favourite Willy Wonka Candy! </div>
<div></div>
<h3>#2. Marshmallow Peeps</h3>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/marshmallow-peeps-top-10-candies-from-the-1950s-candy-district.png?v=1536447860" alt="Marshmallow Peeps-Top 10 Candies from the 1950's"></p>
<div>This brightly coloured, luscious Marshmallow Peeps are most often associated with Easter, but let's face it, Peeps retro candy with all their delicious and sweet squishiness is "always in season". These retro candies came along in 1953 and are made by <a href="https://www.justborn.com/" target="_blank" title="Just Born" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Just Born</strong></a>. Believe it or not, these cute little marshmallow chicks were once made by hand until Just Born started to mass produce them. Every year Peep candies adorn Easter tables and Easter baskets, the spring season is, of course when they are most abundant. But Peeps are now available all year round! This started in 2014, when customers decided once a year just was just not enough. Coming in a variety of different shapes and also colours, we continue to indulge in their sweet, airy appeal!</div>
<div></div>
<h3>#3.Chupa Chups Lollipops</h3>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/chupa-chups-lollipops-top-10-candies-from-the-1950s-candy-district.png?v=1536448304" alt="Chupa Chups Lollipops-Top 10 Candies from the 1950's"></p>
<div>This delicious retro lollipop was founded in 1958. Chupa Chups Lollipops are sold in over 150 countries around the world. It's one of the most well-known candies of our time. This brand was started by Enric Bernat of Spain until Italian- Dutch corporation <a href="http://www.perfettivanmelle.com/" target="_blank" title="Chupa Chups Lollipops" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Perfetti Van Melle</strong></a> took it over. If you're wondering why these lollipops are called Chupa Chups, it's the Spanish word which means "to suck". The Chupa Chups logo was designed by the famed artist, <a href="https://www.salvador-dali.org/en/" target="_blank" title="Salvador Dali" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Salvador Dali</strong> </a>in 1969. These retro lollipops are a worldwide phenomenon. Chupa Chups Lollipops are that delicious!</div>
<div></div>
<h3>#4. Satellite Wafers</h3>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/satellite-wafers-top-10-candies-from-the-1950s-candy-district.png?v=1536448907" alt="Satellite Wafers-Top 10 Candies from the 1950's"></p>
<div>Satellite Wafers or as some call them Flying Saucers, came out in the early part of the 1950's. This retro candy is truly unique in its form. Made to resemble a "flying saucer" the outside is made of a paper-like wafer confection. The inside is filled with powdered sugar and colourful, small candy beads. Most people attest that the outside really has no flavour and could be compared to cardboard. It's the inside that's all the appealing candy sensation with the Satellite Wafer retro candy. There is a lack of history about these UFO-like shaped candies. Why they were made, and just what inspired someone to create them remains as mysterious as UFO. Satellite Wafers are most often found in Belgium where they're made, but there are other companies who produce them now such as Gerrits and Astra Sweets. A fun and interesting retro candy that is sweetly baffling!</div>
<div></div>

<div>This retro candy first came out in 1950, and by the 1960's it had become a top-selling candy! Bonomo Turkish Taffy is a sweet taste of days gone by. However you eat it, freeze it, smack it, crack it, it's always a chewy and pleasurable taffy. Bonomo Turkish Taffy before it was made in individual bar size, was originally sold in large sheets to Woolworth stores which would be broken into bite-size pieces for the customers. When the bars were finally released they sold for five cents. This retro Taffy is considered a long lasting treat. It does take some time to eat a bar, but  Bonomo Turkish Taffy is worth savouring. In 1989 Bonomo decided to discontinue their Taffy, this caused such upset for the fans. In 2003, a website was set up to take advanced orders, as Bonomo announced they would be re-releasing their delicious Taffy again. In 2010, we could once again bite into this exquisite, luscious Taffy. Bonomo Turkish taffy comes in four flavours, Strawberry, Vanilla, Chocolate and Banana. </div>

<p><span>The world in the 1940's was somewhat tumultuous. With WWII ushering in the decade there was some unrest and new realities that people had to face. Although the war changed many things, there were still some bright new ideas to be had.  During the 1940's the world was introduced to televisions with colour! The Polaroid Camera came to be, producing photos instantaneously, well, within a minute. Over 55% of the population finally had indoor plumbing, and the cool new toy around was the "Slinky".</span></p>
<div>The sound of "Swing" music played on the newly invented Jukebox, and the faint echo of Rock N Roll could be heard emerging in Rhythm and Blues music, Gospel and Jazz.
<div>Besides all the great music, the people of the 1940's had candy! Certain ingredients were rationed, but they still found a way to give the folks of the 40's all that soothing, sweet candy!</div>

<p> </p>
<div>The appetizing Almond Joy Candy Bar first introduced in 1946. This old-fashioned candy bar consists of a chewy and satisfying coconut filling, studded with almonds on top and completely enrobed in all of the goodness of rich and creamy milk chocolate.

This old-fashioned candy has only grown since the 1940's, not only are there the original fruity selection of Jolly Rancher Candy, there are now Jolly Rancher Lollipops to be had, hot and spicy Jolly Ranchers and chewy morsels. The one thing they all have in common is that intense, superb taste of Jolly Rancher flavours that we've come to know and love!</div>

<div>This famous, old fashioned candy made its unforgettable debut in 1941. M&amp;M's Candy was invented by Forrest Mars, the son of Frank Mars. Candy was in the genes for this family! Forrest first thought of M&amp;M's while in Spain during the civil war. He noticed the British soldiers eating handfuls of a round, hard-shelled candy. He became very interested in this candy, he soon discovered they were a hard candy shelled, coated chocolate. This got Forrest very intrigued, as he had a candy connection! Forrest Mars got his candy patented when he returned home and partnered up with Bruce Murrie. The M&amp;M candy was born! A chocolate filled little round, colourful candy that was delicious, and at at the same time so convenient to eat. Bruce and Forrest created one of the most popular, and loved candies of all times! </div>
<div>M&amp;M's were given to the soldiers of WWII as they would not melt, and give them some much-needed fuel. The US Army was M&amp;M's very first big customer.</div>
<div>In 1949, M&amp;M's coined the slogan " Melts in your mouth, not in your hand." Always a bonus when eating chocolate! </div>
<div>These colourful gems have been filled with various fillings since then, and even come in some different colours. The<a href="http://www.mms.com/" target="_blank" title=" M&amp;M Candy Collection" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong> M&amp;M Candy Collection</strong></a> is an iconic old fashioned candy that is now known and loved worldwide!</div>

      <![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span>Old Fashioned Candy made us feel good.</span></h2>
<p><span>During the 1930's the world experienced the Great Depression. This changed people's lives dramatically. The economy was doing the exact opposite of the glory days of the 1920's. It became very difficult to find work and also hard to manage a household. They had to find inexpensive activities that would help them to lift their spirits.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/top-10-candies-from-the-1930s-candy-district.png?v=1535919952" alt="Top 10 Candies from the 1930's-Candy Decades"></span></p>
<div>Besides the invention of the Monopoly Board Game, they played Bingo and wrote chain letters, but one of their greatest joys was candy. There was no shortage of candy, and most of it was very affordable. Yes, that good old-fashioned, familiar, sweet comfort of candy, even in the worst of times has the ability to make us happy.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Here are our Top 10 Candies from the 1930's</strong></div>
<div></div>
<h3>#1. <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/chick-o-stick-candy-bar" target="_blank" title="Chick-O-Stick Candy" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chick-O-Stick Candy</a>
</h3>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/chick-o-stick-old-fashioned-candy-top-10-candies-from_the_1930s-candy-district.png?v=1535911127" alt="Chick-O-Stick Old Fashioned Candy-Top 10 Candies from the 1930's"></p>
<div>This old-fashioned candy has been enjoyed plenty over the years, Chick-O-Stick candy first came out in 1938.  The Chick-O -Sticknis a unique candy bar. With the delicious pairing of a honeycombed candy outside, filled with crunchy peanut butter and then rolled in a coating of delightful toasted coconut. It's a breakable long cylinder shaped stick that makes it easy to share. Or to save some for later if you can! The Chick-O-Stick Candy at the time of its debut first went by the name of "Chicken Bones". (Of course, we Canadians have a very different idea of what <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/ganong-chicken-bones" target="_blank" title="Chicken Bones candy" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Chicken Bones</strong> <strong>candy</strong></a> is all about) The name seems much better suited to this distinctively crunchy, orange, old-fashioned candy. </div>
<div></div>
<h3>#2. Big Hunk Candy Bar</h3>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/big-hunk-old-fashioned-candy-top-10-candies-from_the_1930s-candy-district.png?v=1535911348" alt="Big Hunk Old Fashioned Candy-Top 10 Candies from the 1930's"></p>
<div>This old-fashioned candy bar is nothing short of chewy, delicious decadence. The Big Hunk Candy Bar is filled with roasted peanuts that are covered in a supremely chewy honey nougat. This Candy Bar first came out in the early 1930's and is from the <a href="https://annabellecandy.com/" target="_blank" title="Annabelle Candy Company" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Annabelle Candy Company</strong></a>. The same makers of the famous <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/abba-zaba-bar" target="_blank" title="Abba Zabba Candy Bar" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Abba Zabba Candy Bar</strong></a>. The old-fashioned Big Hunk gained major popularity upon its release and soon after became a top seller. Some people prefer to freeze this candy bar before eating it and then breaking it into smaller more manageable pieces. But if you're into supremely chewy and heavenly delicious nougat, eating the Big Hunk as is, is perfect!</div>
<div></div>
<h3>#3.<a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/necco-candy-buttons" target="_blank" title="Candy Buttons" rel="noopener noreferrer">Candy Buttons</a>
</h3>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/candy-buttons-old-fashioned-candy-top-10-candies-from_the_1930s-candy-district.png?v=1535911533" alt="Candy Buttons Old Fashioned Candy-Top 10 Candies from the 1930's"></p>
<div>Originally Candy Buttons were introduced to us in the 1930's and made by the Cumberland Valley Company. Then they were acquired by <strong>NECCO</strong> in 1980. These cute little Candy Buttons are made to resemble small buttons and come stuck on a sheet of wax paper. The paper is not edible, just the candy! Often Candy Buttons are used to decorate cupcakes and cakes. These old fashioned candies, besides being pretty, so sweetly and softly melt on your tongue. Candy Buttons although an old-fashioned candy is still a popular candy today. There are approximately 750 million Candy Buttons made every year! The original three flavours of Candy Buttons are, cherry(pink) lime (blue) and lime (yellow). Candy Buttons are a unique sort of candy and seem to be very entertaining to eat, especially for children. </div>
<div>An old-fashioned candy that has not lost any of it's "cuteness" appeal!</div>
<div></div>
<h3>#4. Boston Baked Beans</h3>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/boston-baked-beans-old-fashioned-candy-top-10-candies-from_the_1930s-candy-district.png?v=1535911760" alt="Boston Baked Beans Old Fashioned Candy-Top 10 Candies from the 1930's"></p>
<div>Boston Baked Beans first hit the candy scene in the early 1930's. This old-fashioned candy is made by the <a href="http://www.ferrarausa.com/" target="_blank" title="Ferrara Candy" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Ferrara Candy</strong></a>, the same makers of the famous Atomic Fireball Jawbreakers. Boston Baked Beans do not contain any beans! Inside these red little candies, are peanuts that are coated in layers upon layers of a crunchy candy coating. Baked Beans were a very popular dish at the time, hence the name "Boston Baked Beans".  I'm sure most of us would prefer the red and candy-coated Boston Baked Beans! A classic candy that is simple but undisputedly delicious!  Boston Baked Beans remain one of the most perfect crunchy candies around!</div>
<div></div>
<h3>#5. <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/5th-avenue-bar" target="_blank" title="5th Avenue Candy Bar" rel="noopener noreferrer">5th Avenue Candy Bar</a>
</h3>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/5th-avenue-bar-old-fashioned-candy-top-10-candies-from_the_1930s-candy-district.png?v=1535911973" alt="5th Avenue Bar Old Fashioned Candy-Top 10 Candies from the 1930's"></p>
<div>This lavish old fashioned Candy bar came out in 1936. It was Invented by William H. Luden. The 5th Avenue is made of layers of pleasant, crunchy peanut butter that is enrobed in rich milk chocolate. A great combination of both flavour and texture. Originally William H. Luden was famous for his cough drops but decided to branch out in the candy business. There are two stories about why he named the Candy Bar 5th Avenue. Some say it was the name of the street he grew up on as a boy in Pennsylvania, others speculate he wanted to incorporate the elegance of New York's 5th Avenue to come to mind when eating his bar, making it seem all that much more decadent. Whatever the case, regardless of any name that this Candy Bar might have, the 5th Avenue Candy Bar is an old-fashioned chocolate treat that has remained a classic and satisfying candy bar since the 1930's.</div>
<div></div>
<h3>#6. <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/sugar-babies-candy" target="_blank" title="Sugar Babies Candy" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sugar Babies Candy</a>
</h3>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/sugar-babies-old-fashioned-candy-top-10-candies-from_the_1930s-candy-district.png?v=1535912199" alt="Sugar Babies Old Fashioned Candy-Top 10 Candies from the 1930's"></p>
<div>Sugar Babies Candies are an old-fashioned favourite, slow cooked, milk caramel candy. Pan coated with layers and layers of the flavoursome sweetness of milk caramel. These babies are nothing short of pure caramel bliss! The sweet child of the famed Sugar Daddy Caramel Lollipop, Sugar Babies came out in 1935. These caramel candies are soft and chewy on the inside with a harder candy coating of caramel on the outside. A double hit of all the sublime caramel you can handle! </div>
<div></div>
<h3>#7. Red Hots Cinnamon Candy</h3>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/red-hots-old-fashioned-candy-top-10-candies-from_the_1930s-candy-district.png?v=1535912428" alt="Red Hots Old Fashioned Candy-Top 10 Candies from the 1930's"></p>
<div>With all the intense and fiery flavour of cinnamon, Red Hots are simply bursting with the fierce taste of spicy cinnamon. Red Hots Cinnamon candy is an old-fashioned candy that is made by The Ferrara Pan Candy Company. The Ferrara Pan Candy Company is also the maker of Atomic Fireballs and the previously mentioned, Boston Baked Beans. This company simply takes the cake when creating delicious panned candy! Red Hots Cinnamon candy came out in the early 1930's. Even though these red candies are tiny, they certainly pack a huge hit of flavour. Sweet with heat, Red Hots Cinnamon Candy leaves an impression on your taste buds. Smaller than the likes of the "Atomic Fireball" and about a notch less hot, faster to eat, other than that these old-fashioned candies are almost twins! Red Hot Cinnamon candies were originally called Cinnamon Imperials. Red Hots Cinnamon Candy is a much more suitable name for this spicy candy! </div>

<div>This distinctive candy bar came out in 1932. Although the Payday Candy Bar does not include any chocolate, it's absence is definitely not missed. The Payday Candy bar is fully loaded with crunchy, salted peanuts rolled in caramel, that all surround a firm like nougat center. Truly a delectable tasting bar, as the salty peanuts really enhance the caramel and nougat taste. When the Payday Candy Bar first came out they just could not think of a name, until one employee who worked at the factory suggested "Payday" as it just happened to coincide with their payday. In a nutshell, this old fashioned candy bar is a refreshing change from the usual. The Payday Candy Bar is packed with delicious textures and flavours and is a pleasurable, pick me up candy for any time!</div>

<div>The 3 Musketeers  Bar is an old-fashioned, favourite candy bar. It's been feeding the likes of all those fluffy, nougat and chocolate fans for generations now! This old-fashioned candy bar came out in 1932. Originally the 3 Musketeers Bar was a three-part bar. It consisted of three mini portions that each offered a differently flavoured nougat, vanilla strawberry and chocolate. This trio eventually changed in 1945 and began to only feature the chocolate flavoured nougat and of course the chocolate. The claim to fame upon the 3 Musketeers Candy Bar debut, was that it was "So big you could share it with three friends".  A heartwarming thought for those generous candy lovers, but let's face it would you really want to share this most awesome candy bar? </div>

<div>Introduced in exactly 1930, the Snickers Candy Bar is an old-fashioned candy bar that has been feeding our chocolate cravings for generations! The Snickers Candy Bar consists of chewy nougat that is filled with crunchy peanuts and creamy caramel, that is then entirely enrobed in milk chocolate. The Snickers Chocolate Bar was brought to us by Frank Mars, the man behind what is now <a href="https://www.mars.com/global" target="_blank" title="Mars Incorporated" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Mars Incorporated</strong></a>. As a young child, Frank Mars could often be found alongside his mother making candy in the kitchen. As Frank grew older, he realized that making candy was his calling in life. Frank and his wife, Ethel started the Mar-O-Bar Company in 1920. Their candy business flourished and surpassed what Frank and Ethel ever thought was possible. </div>
<div>The Snickers Candy Bar was named after the couples beloved racehorse, named "Snickers". Unfortunately, their horse Snickers passed about two months before the Snickers Bar came out. </div>
<div>Over the years the famous and loved Snickers Candy Bar has never lost its delicious appeal. It's a staple in the sweet world of Candy Bars, and one of the most popular reached for candy bars to this day!</div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Sweet times with old fashioned candy in the 1930's</h3>
<div></div>
<div>The 1930's certainly had their fair share challenges. Any bit of a sweetness must have been so anticipated and appreciated.

<p style="text-align: center;"><span><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/top-10-candies-from-the-1920s-candy-district.png?v=1535504881" alt="Top 10 Candies from the 1920's"></span></p>
<p><span>The roaring 20's, that they were! The world was changing, people were bolder and had much more of a rebellious attitude. The fashion had completely changed, especially for females. Any bit of being "Victorian" looking or modest went out the window. Organized crime was at an all-time high, fueled by prohibition. There were bootleggers, flappers and this cool new music called "jazz". Most people began to discover the "city" life, and less lived in rural areas and farms. The economy was booming, there were shiny new cars on the road, money to be made, and lots of brand new inventions. Besides the new innovative washing machines, refrigerators, radios and televisions, there was lots of delicious new candy to be had! </span></p>
<div>
<br>
<h3>Here are our top ten candies from the 1920's:</h3>
<div></div>
</div>
<div></div>
<h3>#1. <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/oh-henry-bar" target="_blank" title="Oh Henry Chocolate Bar" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oh Henry Chocolate Bar</a>
</h3>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/oh-henry-candy-bars-top-10-candies-of-the-1920s-candy-district.png?v=1535486426" alt="Oh Henry Candy Bars-Top 10 Candies of the 1920's"></p>
<div>The Oh Henry Chocolate Bar is fully loaded, with roasted peanuts, caramel and that "big hunk of fudge". Along with all this decadence, it is then completely wrapped in rich milk chocolate. The old-fashioned Oh Henry Chocolate Bars were brought to us by, Tom Henry from Arkansas City, Kansas, in 1919. Tom Henry ran a candy company called "The Peerless Candy Factory". He must have been inspired by the wafting scent of all that sweet candy! Tom Henry wanted to cash in on his chocolate bar, that went by the name of "Tom Henry". Eventually, he decided to sell his namesake Chocolate Bar in 1920, to the "Williamson Candy Company". That's when this chocolate bar was renamed the "Oh Henry". They say it got this name because there was a young and curious boy who loved to frequent the Williamson Factory. Upon his visits, he especially loved to assist all the young ladies working, and they could often be heard calling for help from Henry, hence the name "Oh Henry". I can just hear it now! The Oh Henry Chocolate Bar remains just as delicious as it was in the 1920's!</div>
<div></div>
<h3>#2. <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/abba-zaba-bar" target="_blank" title="Abba Zabba Candy Bar" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abba Zabba Candy Bar</a>
</h3>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/abba-zabba-candy-bars-top-10-candies-of-the-1920s-candy-district.png?v=1535486718" alt="Abba Zaba Bars-Top 10 Candies from the 1920's"></p>
<div>This distinctive, old-fashioned candy bar, Abba Zabba, is more than appealing. With its unique combination of vanilla taffy and peanut butter, this delicious, dynamic duo of flavours come together wonderfully to create the perfect old-fashioned candy bar, Abba Zabba. This famous treat was brought to us by a Russian immigrant, Sam Altshuler. He had just arrived in America in 1917, just a few short years before the Abba Zabba became a popular candy bar. Sam Altshuler owned a candy company he called the "<a href="http://annabellecandy.com/" target="_blank" title="Annabelle Candy Company" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Annabelle Candy Company</strong></a>" which was named after his daughter. The Abba Zabba Candy Bar came to be in 1922 and very quickly got noticed. Those Flappers and Gangsters must have worked up quite an appetite! The Abba Zabba became a number one seller in America. It's hard not to notice this candy bar with it's black and yellow checkerboard wrapper. The Annabelle Candy Company have brought us some other old-fashioned treats such as the <strong>Big Hunk Candy Bar</strong>, The <strong>Look Candy Bar</strong> and the <strong>Rocky Road Chocolate Bar</strong>. Abba Zabba has been loved for years now, in fact for generations. It was probably made most famous by Dave Chappelle in the movie, Half Baked when he referred to his Abba Zabba bar as "his only friend". I say the Abba Zabba is a great friend to have!</div>
<div></div>
<h3>#3. <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/baby-ruth-bar" target="_blank" title="Baby Ruth Candy Bar" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baby Ruth Candy Bar</a>
</h3>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/baby-ruth-candy-bars-top-10-candies-of-the-1920s-candy-district.png?v=1535496501" alt="Baby Ruth Candy Bars-Top 10 Candies of the 1920's"></p>
<div>This old-fashioned and irresistible candy bar first came out in 1921. The Baby Ruth Candy Bar is fully loaded with chocolate flavoured nougat, creamy caramel, and fresh peanuts, that is then covered in milk chocolate. This candy bar is often mistaken for being named after the famous baseball player, Babe Ruth when in fact the Baby Ruth Candy Bar was named after President Grover Cleveland's daughter, Ruth. The old-fashioned Baby Ruth Chocolate Bar gained some massive notoriety when in 1923, thousands of Baby Ruth Chocolate Bars fell out of the sky over Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. These chocolate bars were dropped out of an airplane, each attached to their very own mini parachute! They were also dropped that same year among various other States across the U.S.A. It almost sounds too good to be true, chocolate bars from the sky! The people of the 1920's sure knew how to advertise!</div>
<div></div>
<h3>#4.<a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/haribo-gold-bears" target="_blank" title="Haribo Gold Bears" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haribo Gold Bears</a>
</h3>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/haribo-gold-bears-gummy-candy-top-10-candies-of-the-1920s-candy-district.png?v=1535500685" alt="Haribo Gold Bears-Top 10 Candies of the 1920's"></p>
<div>Haribo Gold Bears were the very first gummy bears that were ever made, making them the "original" gummi bear! The year was 1922, and Hans Riegel of Germany the founder of Haribo introduced us to these delicious gummi bears. The Haribo Gold Bears are not only perfectly chewy, they are bursting with impeccable, full fruity flavour! Haribo Gold Bears just beg to be eaten, coming in five juicy flavours, Pineapple, Strawberry, Lemon, Orange and Raspberry.  Hans Riegel says he was inspired to make gummi bears because of his travels in Europe. He had seen dancing bears performing at festivals and somehow wanted to incorporate these cute bears into candy. Hans gave these bears candy life, and the sweetest gummi candy ever! From the roaring 20's to the fast pace of today, nothing beats the original, old-fashioned Haribo Gold Bears!</div>
<div></div>
<h3>#5. <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/collections/dubble-bubble" target="_blank" title="Dubble Bubble Bubble Gum" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dubble Bubble Bubble Gum</a>
</h3>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/dubble-bubble-bubblegum-top-10-candies-of-the-1920s-candy-district.png?v=1535501025" alt="Dubble Bubble Bubblegum-Top 10 Candies of the 1920's"></p>
<div>This old-fashioned bubble gum has always hit the spot! Pink, chewy and luscious, nothing blows bubbles like the old-fashioned Dubble Bubble Bubble Gum! This nostalgic Bubble Gum came out in 1928. Invented By Walter Diemer, who was an employee of the Fleer Chewing Gum Company. Walter didn't work in the factory, but behind a desk as an accountant. Walter had a very interesting passion besides numbers, bubble gum! Walter had tried to make his own bubble gum concoction but never seemed to be successful at it. Frank Fleer, on the other hand, had made many prototypes of bubble gum over the years, and some were better than others. Walter Diemer decided one day to play around with one of Frank's 20-year-old, flopped, bubble gum recipes. Walter, the bubble gum fanatic, finally figured out the perfect recipe for Dubble Bubble, almost 20 years later! Within Dubble Bubbles first year on the market, it sold a whopping 1.5 million dollars worth of bubble gum! Dubble Bubble old fashioned Bubble Gum still comes with the Fleer Funnies inside the wrapper. Dubble Bubble is a sweet and aromatic chew on pure nostalgia!</div>
<div></div>
<h3>#6. PEZ Candy</h3>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/pez-candy-top-10-candies-of-the-1920s-candy-district.png?v=1535501408" alt="PEZ Candy-Top 10 Candies of the 1920's"></p>
<div>This novelty candy was the first of it's kind. A tablet like candy that comes in a convenient dispenser. PEZ Candy, although an old-fashioned candy, was also innovative for its time. PEZ was invented in 1927 by Edward Haas the third, of Austria. The original flavour of PEZ candy only came in Peppermint. The German word for peppermint is "pfefferminz" which is where the name PEZ originates from.</div>
<div>PEZ Candy was originally meant to be a form of smoking cessation, helping people to kick the habit. But with such a strong peppermint taste it was popular with adults only and not children. PEZ eventually added a selection of fruity tasting candy and fun PEZ dispensers. They dropped their racy ads of scantily dressed pin-up girls and began to gear their PEZ Candy advertisements towards children and their approving parents. PEZ Candy has only grown since it's conception, it's an extremely popular novelty candy for children and adult PEZ Candy dispenser collectors. PEZ Candy is pop culture, a candy and a toy. It's the stuff that we all ate and craved as children. PEZ  is made in Connecticut and makes over 12 million tablets of PEZ candy to this day!</div>
<div></div>
<h3>#7. <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/collections/reeses" target="_blank" title="Reese's Peanut Butter Cups" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reese's Peanut Butter Cups</a>
</h3>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/reeses-peanut-butter-cups-top-10-candies-of-the-1920s-candy-district.png?v=1535501628" alt="Reese's Peanut Butter Cups-Top 10 Candies of the 1920's"></p>
<div>It was 1928, and the world never knew that such sumptuous, deliciousness existed! Until the good old fashioned Reese's Peanut Butter Cups came to town! Cups made of decadent milk chocolate, filled to the brim with smooth and creamy peanut butter. Could a pair be any more perfect? Reese's Peanut Butter Cups were created by H.B Reese, who happened to be an employee of Milton Hershey.   (the chocolate mogul) Reese was so inspired by the success of the Hershey's Company, he branched out on his own, with the backing and support of Milton Hershey.  He left his job at Hershey's, and created one of the most popular old-fashioned, well-loved, treats around! H.B Reese used Hersheys Chocolate in his old-fashioned confections. He made many other treats but none were as successful as his Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. The Reese's Brand has greatly expanded over the years, with a huge collection of many enticing confections. Reeses' Peanut Butter Cups remain a number one seller across North America. One of the greatest old-fashioned candy inventions around!</div>
<div></div>
<h3>#8. <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/sherbert-fountain" target="_blank" title="Sherbet Fountain" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sherbet Fountain</a>
</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="Sherbet Fountain-Top 10 Candies of the 1920's" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/sherbert-fountain-top-10-candies-of-the-1920s-candy-district.png?v=1535501931" style="float: none;"></p>
<div>The Sherbet Fountain is a classic old-fashioned candy that came out in 1925. The packaging has changed since the 1920's but it's just as delicious as it ever was. The Sherbet Fountain Candy is a fizzy, lemon flavoured sherbet that is accompanied with a black licorice stick. The stick is meant to dip inside all that yummy sherbet confection! The packaging nowadays is much more hygienic, and actually enhances the fizziness of the Sherbet portion of the candy.  The licorice stick is now tucked into the tube. The Sherbet Fountain remains the sweetest fountain around! Old fashioned and unique, it's a distinctive candy that is loved to this day!</div>
<h3>#9. <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/cadbury-crunchie-uk" target="_blank" title="Crunchie Candy Bar" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crunchie Candy Bar</a>
</h3>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/cadbury-crunchie-bar-top-10-candies-of-the-1920s-candy-district.png?v=1535502188" alt="Cadbury Crunchie Bar-Top 10 Candies of the 1920's"></p>
<div>A crunchy and satisfying old-fashioned candy bar. The Crunchie Candy Bar is a piece of delightfully and airy, yet crunchy sponge toffee that is covered in milk chocolate. Every bite is filled with flavourful texture, the rich milk chocolate and sponge toffee flavours are very enhanced by each other. The Crunchie Candy Bar came out in 1929, in the UK and quickly spread it's "crunchy" and delicious flavour all over the world!  The Crunchie Bar has not lost its appeal in the least bit. It may be old fashioned, but after one bite you know this candy bar is as exquisite tasting as ever! The wrapper is even golden to go along with it's golden honeycombed, toffee taste. I bet the folks of the 1920's were so glad there was no ban on chocolate! </div>

<h3>#10. <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/collections/charleston-chew-candy" target="_blank" title="Charleston Chew Candy Bar" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charleston Chew Candy Bar</a>

<div>Smack dab in the middle of the 1920's, a brand new candy bar arrived on the scene. The Charleston Chew Candy Bar came out in 1925. This old-fashioned candy bar was named after a popular dance craze at the time called "The Charleston". The Charleston Chew Candy Bar is made of chewy and mouthwatering nougat on the inside, all wrapped with a coating of chocolate on the outside. A real celebration of the roaring 20's, the wrappers and flappers must have been flying across dancefloors everywhere! The Charleston Chew Candy Bars were originally made by the Fox-Cross Candy Company, but are now made by Tootsie Roll Industries.</div>
<div>Charleston Chew Candy Bars are available in a vanilla flavoured nougat, chocolate or strawberry. You might just break out in dance, perhaps learn to dance the Charleston! Yes, the old-fashioned Charleston Chew Candy Bar, it's that irresistibly delicious!</div>

<div></div>
<div>Amongst all those roaring and rebellious 1920's attitudes, fabulous flappers, and daring gangsters, came some memorable and remarkable tasting candy!

<h2>Old Fashioned Candy from a Simpler Time</h2>
</div>
<div>Imagine having to walk miles for your favourite chocolate bar, or travelling to the general store by horse and buggy? That's what getting your candy cravings in the early 1900's would have been like.</div>
<div>During the 1900's, the living was very simple when compared to today's standard of living. There was no running water, no toilets and no showers. The way to get around was with a horse and buggy, or with your own two feet. Having a job in that day and age is what we would consider hard labour today. There were no cars on the roads, no television, internet or cell phones. Their main form of entertainment consisted of families gathering together in the evenings and singing their favourite songs. If you were well off you could do some ballroom dancing, and hire musicians who travelled with their own instruments to perform for you.</div>
<div>Sure they did without a lot of amenities we take for granted today, but one thing they still enjoyed as much as we do, is candy! You probably think you've never tasted any candy from that era, but I'm sure you have.</div>
<h3><strong>Here are our top ten candies from the early 1900's...</strong></h3>
<h3>#1. <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/hersheys-milk-chocolate-bar" target="_blank" title="Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bar" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bar</a>
</h3>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/hersheys-milk-chocolate-bar-candy-district.png?v=1534900101" alt="Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bar"></p>
<div>This old-fashioned chocolate bar came out in the year 1900. Some things never go out of style, and this delicious, classic chocolate bar is one of them. A smooth and creamy chocolate bar made with the famous Hershey's milk chocolate. Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bar is often referred to as <strong>"The Great American Chocolate Bar"</strong>. This iconic chocolate bar was introduced to us by Milton Hershey. Mr. Hershey started out making caramel candies, but after a visit to the World's Fair in 1893, he became fascinated with the art of chocolate making. He realized that there was a huge demand for chocolate. Lucky for us, he hit the ground running with his chocolate endeavours! Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bar was a huge success and just a few years later, in 1907, he gave us the famous <strong>Hershey's Kisses</strong>. These morsels of supreme goodness were also a huge hit with candy lovers. Only a year later in 1908, Milton Hershey introduced us to the  <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/hersheys-milk-chocolate-almond-bar" target="_blank" title="Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bar with Almonds" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bar with Almonds</strong></a>. To this day, Milton Hershey's chocolate is loved all over the world, along with his many other famous treats. The Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bar is a decadent yet simple treasure we love to this day! </div>

<div>Cracker Jack was first introduced in 1896. This old-fashioned treat is a  molasses flavoured popcorn, with a delicious coating of caramel, and the addition of crunchy peanuts. This old-fashioned snack has been loved for generations, and is still a sought-after treat to this day! Besides the Cracker Jack delightful popcorn, every box still comes with a prize inside! Cracker Jack was introduced at the World's Fair in 1871, by German Immigrant, Fredrick William Rueckheim. It took a few years but finally, his sweet concoction became world famous! The Cracker Jack boxes still feature it's two cute mascots, Sailor Jack and his loveable dog, Bingo. These characters are actually based on the German creator's grandson and dog. Inside of every box of Cracker Jack, is not only the popcorn and prize but sweet memories.</div>

<div>This old fashioned candy really is "A Hole Lot Of Fun". Brought to us in 1912, Pep-O-Mint Life Savers was the very first flavour of the Life Savers candy brand. Invented by Clarence Crane because he wanted a candy that would not melt in the sun. He also insisted that his candy be a round shape with a hole in the center in order to make them different than any other candy on the market. After a years time, Clarence Crane was approached by businessman Edward Noble, who wanted to buy the Life Savers brand. Clarence obliged and in 1913 he sold Life Savers for $2,900.00. Edward Noble along with his partner grew the brand into a million dollar corporation. The packaging was changed to the iconic rolls of candy we know today, and the flavours eventually expanded. The <strong>Life Savers Butter Rum</strong> flavour has become a huge hit with customers along with the <strong>Life Savers Five Flavour</strong> Mix. Life Savers Candy has satisfied our cravings and "saved" our candy desires for well over 100 years!</div>

<div>Maynards Wine Gums were introduced in 1909. This old-fashioned candy has been a classic for generations. Maynards Wine Gums are known and appreciated for their chewy texture. Never being too sticky or stretchy. Their fruity flavours are distinctive, delectable and intense and meant to resemble the taste of a port or fine wine. Despite the name "Wine Gums", these candies contain no alcohol and were actually made in order to deter people from drinking. Maynards Wine Gums are made with natural colour and real fruit juice, which is always an added benefit. Overall, Maynards Wine Gums are sweet with a hint of tartness. The variety of delicious flavours include Lemon, Orange, Lime, Black Current, Grapefruit and Raspberry.

Thought of by George Renninger of Philadelphia, until it was acquired by the Goelitz Confection Company which is the largest producer of Candy Corn to this day. There are 35 million pounds made every year, which is equivalent to 9 billion individual pieces. A popular candy especially during Halloween season and Thanksgiving. Often candy corn is used as an accent candy, representing the Autumn season, used on dessert tables, and candy buffets. Candy Corn is a polarizing candy.

McCraw's Old Fashioned Taffy is a long and thin, mouthwatering, flat piece of taffy. The original flavour is vanilla, but now there are even more delicious varieties, which include, Rainbow, Cotton Candy, Banana and Grape. There is no other taffy that comes in such a thin and fragile form. It may be delicate but serves to melt on your tongue so very perfectly.

<div>A plump and juicy Maraschino Cherry that is surrounded in a sweet cherry syrup and covered with chocolate, coconut and bits of perfectly roasted peanuts. This Canadian concoction was first introduced to us in the early 1890's. The Cherry Blossom has somewhat of a sophisticated taste. I must admit that as a child, it was a chocolate that my grandmother ate and I only ever begrudgingly tried it. Until I was older and a little wiser, with a more discriminating palate, this Canadian Candy gem became one of my all-time favourites. This old-fashioned, Canadian Candy has been loved for well over 100 years! The delectable, deliciousness of the Cherry Blossom Candy definitely has staying power!</div>

<div>Every Canadian has tried this gum at least once, whether or not they liked it is a different story! Thrills Gum is a unique Canadian Gum. A retro, purple gum that has a very distinctive taste. Some say that Thrills Gum tastes like soap, being that Rosewater is one of the main ingredients is where the "soapy" taste comes from.  There is just no sitting on the fence with Thrills Gum, you either hate or love it. But one thing is for certain, Thrills Gum is one of a kind! Originally Thrills Gum was manufactured by the O Pee Chee Company from London, Ontario, until in the 1980's it was bought by Nestle. This sweet and soapy purple gum, as strange as it might sound to some, is actually delicious! Maybe it's an acquired Canadian taste, whatever the reason it's a sweet way to stop all that colourful language! Thrills Gum does taste better than Zest!</div>

<div>If you ask anyone about their favourite candy, you'll see that light in their eyes as they sweetly reminisce all about the good old days! That retro, old fashioned candy that still tugs at our heartstrings, the candy we can still taste from so long ago!</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/sweet-memories-with-old-fashioned-candy-candyblog.png?v=1501884654" alt="Sweet Memories with Old Fashion Candy and Candy Queen"></div>
<div></div>
<div>The weekly allowance we so eagerly spent at the corner store,down the street. Delighting in that brown paper bag! The grandmother that always happen to have your candy of choice on hand, or gave you a few dollars to go and buy it. Or that favourite aunt, that always had the prettiest crystal dishes full of it!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Maybe you remember Christmas, all that excitement on Christmas morning, racing downstairs to dump your stocking full of treats, and of course stealing all the candy canes that adorned the tree! Perhaps, it's Easter you think of, a basket full of chocolate and jelly beans and half eaten bunny ears. What about Halloween! When you dressed up, proudly screaming "trick or treat" at the top of your lungs. Collecting bags or pillowcases of candy, comparing who got more of what and, "I'll trade ya" this for that. Yes, those were the days, the sweet good old days!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Unfortunately, we grow up and have to become responsible adults, but adults, that still love candy! We all still have that special old fashioned candy we love to remember! Candy that our childhood heart still craves, and takes us all the way back to those sweet memories.Those candy memories, that live on the streets we grew up on, with the kids we played with, in those long summer days that we thought would last forever. You can taste it again</div>
<div></div>
<div>Here are some of the most popular retro candies that we hope you've not forgotten! </div>

<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
<div>A box full of sweetness, and a surprise! What a treat these are! A blend of caramel coated popcorn and crunchy peanuts, of course with a prize in every box! Who could ever forget the anticipation of that prize! Cracker Jack are an old fashion snack. If you're old enough, just looking at the box takes you back to a simpler time. The sailor "Jack" on the front of his box is named after the founder of Cracker Jack's grandson. Who could blame him, he makes for a great mascot with his cute little dog "Bingo" alongside. Cracker Jack came out in 1893. Invented by Frederick William Rueckheim and his brother, Louis. Cracker Jack's first debut took place at he very first Chicago World's Fair and are still popular to this day. I think this tasty old fashioned snack has some staying power!</div>

<div>Who could ever forget these! Pops of delicious candy literally exploding in your mouth! Pop Rocks were once rumoured to explode in your stomach if combined with a can of <span class="m_2570137573601293788m_377112602193103138m_4221633804889314898m_828088502322481371m_-3213604479291812946m_-3325023681213370025m_8132921280305548531gmail-il">pop</span>. The rumors have since been dismissed, and there are millions of us still alive after trying this dare! I did, and I live to tell the tale! The biggest rumor about Pop Rocks, was that Mikey from the Life Cereal commercials died because his stomach exploded. This is NOT TRUE! He is alive and well today! There was even a special hotline set up for concerned parents. Pop Rocks have certainly had their share of fame. They are a pretty amazing candy, you don't just taste them, you actually feel them explode. They are fun to eat for the sensation and also really do taste great. Pop Rocks were stumbled upon by an accident, by a chemist that worked for General Foods. William A. Mitchell. He was trying to come up with an instant soft drink but realized what he had created was far better and more interesting than an instant soda. Pop Rocks were patented in 1956, but didn't hit the shelves until two decades later. Better late then never! Grab a pack of your favourite Pop Rocks and drink a pop with them. <strong>I dare you!!!</strong>

One Atomic Fireball lasts a long time. You can't break them open and chew them. Atomic Fireball are much too hard, They're a special "hot" jawbreaker.

The finders of the tickets are Veruca Salt, a spoiled girl, Augustus Gloop, a greedy boy, Mike Teavee, a boy who watches television throughout the day, Violet Beauregarde, a girl who is fond of chewing gums and chews it all day and lastly Charlie Bucket, a poor boy. They were led by Mr. Wonka on a tour of the factory.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/willy-wonka-the-sweetest-story-ever-told-inside-the-chocolate-factory-candy-district.png?v=1500054822" alt="Willy Wonka The Sweetest Story Ever Told-Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"></span></p>
<p><span>The factory turned out to be a place of wonders where every child’s sweet fantasies come to life. Almost everything was chewable, and there was even a river of chocolate! However, misfortunes befall the other children one by one due to their spoiled behavior. Augustus Gloop was the first to leave the group as he falls into a chocolate river due to greediness, and gets sucked into a pipe. Veruca followed when she was thrown down the rubbish chute, then Violet turned into a blueberry after excessive chewing, and Mike teleports himself to a few inches tall.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span>The Candy Industry Influenced Roald Dahl </span></h3>
<p><span>Roald Dahl got his inspiration for ‘Charles and the Chocolate Factory’ from his experience of chocolate companies during his childhood. <a href="https://www.cadbury.co.uk/" target="_blank" title="Cadbury" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Cadbury</strong></a>, one of the largest Chocolate makers, would often send samples of their products to school children in exchange for their opinions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/willy-wonka-the-sweetest-story-ever-told-slugworth-candy-district_aa4ced2f-fdbc-48e6-bc8c-7fce9821c63d.png?v=1500055211" alt="Willy Wonka The Sweetest Story Ever Told-Slugworth"></span></p>
<p><span>The candy industry was very secretive, and it is not uncommon for factories to send spies to work with competitors so as to steal their recipes. This was evident in Wonka’s dismissal of all the factory workers and closing the factory forever. He only re-opened the factory when he brought the loyal Ooma-Loompas to work for him. </span></p>
<p><span>It was the secrecy in the chocolate industries plus the huge machines in their factories that inspired the story.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">
<span> </span><span>Effect on Pop Culture</span>
</h3>
<p><span>The first adaptation of the novel into a film in 1971 as a ‘musical’ titled ‘Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory’, starring Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka. The production was inspired by 10-year-old Madeline Stuart who asked her father to turn into a movie. Mel Stuart , a movie director brought the book to  producer, David Wolper who happened to be in talks with The Quaker Oats Company then. He convinced the company to finance the film version in exchange for the promotion of their candy bars. </span></p>
<p><span>The story was renamed 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' to promote the Wonka Candy Brands. In 1971, the Quaker Oats Company introduced a line of retro candies with the book's character and imagery. Till today, various sweet and chocolate products from Roald Dahl's book are enjoyed by both young and old. The popular <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/collections/wonka-candy" target="_blank" title="Willy Wonka Candy" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Willy Wonka Candy</strong></a> line including <strong>Laffy Taffy</strong>, <strong>Nerds Candy</strong>, <strong>Fun Dip</strong>, <strong>Bottle Caps</strong>, <strong>Kazoozles</strong>, <strong>Shockers</strong>, <strong>Spree</strong>, <strong>Runts</strong>, <strong>Pixty Stix</strong>, <strong>Sweetarts</strong> and <strong>Everlasting Gobstoppers</strong> are just some of the candies inspired by Roald Dahl’s book</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory starring Johnny Depp</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/willy-wonka-the-sweetest-story-ever-told-charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory-johnny-depp-candy-district.png?v=1500055854" alt="Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"></span></p>
<p><span>An original titled version, directed by <a href="http://timburton.com/" target="_blank" title="Tim Burton" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Tim Burton</strong></a>. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was released in 2005 with Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. There were slight modifications to the early version such as Wonka putting the announcement of the golden ticket on a poster and hanging it by himself instead of the newspapers.</span></p>
<p><span>Apart from the film sequels, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has been adapted for different forms of media including radio, the screen, games, and stage as plays or musicals for children. </span></p>
<p><span>Based on Burton’s adaptations, a video game, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was released in 2005. Concurrently, a family attraction themed around the story was opened by the British Theme Park, Alton Towers. Also, an opera show called The Golden Ticket premiered at Opera Theatre of Saint Louis on July 13, 2010.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span>Innovation Keeps Ganong Sweet</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/ganong-a-sweet-canadian-treasure-candy-district.png?v=1499481311" alt="Ganong A Sweet Canadian Treasure-Candy District CandyBlog"></span></p>
<p><span>This sweet Canadian story all started in 1873, when brothers James and Gilbert </span><span>Ganong decided to open a small grocery store in St. Stephen's, New </span><span>Brunswick. </span><span>At the very start of their venture, selling candy was not planned on </span><span>as being a big part of their business. It was their thought that candy </span><span>would be just a small portion of the store. </span><span>The <a href="https://ganong.com/" target="_blank" title="Ganong Brothers" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Ganong Brothers</strong></a> decided that they should specialize in one product, and </span><span>that this would give them an edge on their competition.Something that </span><span>they could be well known for. So they started out with the idea of </span><span>creating their very own brand of soap. Their soap, while I'm sure was </span><span>great, did not prove to be a success. It wasn't until the Ganong </span><span>brothers decided to focus on candy that they came into very big and delicious </span><span>success!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/ganong-a-sweet-canadian-treasure-candy-district-online-candy-warehouse.png?v=1499483745" alt="Ganong Chocolate Candy District CandyBlog"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Candy is what made Ganong such a distinguishable and well loved Canadian company!</strong><br><span>James and Gilbert Ganong truly changed the company with their sweet </span><span>idea of introducing candy, and to this day in every vat of candy there </span><span>still lives their sweet brotherly love, and the magical transformation </span><span>of sugar to candy!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/ganong-a-sweet-canadian-treasure-candyblog-candy-district-online-candy-warehouse.png?v=1499483938" alt="Ganong Chocolate-Candy District"></p>
<p><span><a href="https://ganong.com/" target="_blank" title="Ganong" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Ganong</strong></a> is still located in St. Stephen New Brunswick. It's been </span><span>feeding us mouthwatering and delectable candy and chocolate for over 140 years! </span><span>We can give our many thanks to Ganong for giving us the very first </span><span>chocolate bar! In particular, many thanks to Arthur Ganong. In 1917 </span><span>he became the president of the company, where he held his position for </span><span>40 years. He was most famous for eating at least 2-3 </span><span>pounds of chocolate everyday! </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span>Two Sweet Pals created the Pal-O-Mine Bar</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/ganong-pal-o-mine-bar-candy-district-online-candy-store-canada.png?v=1499476231" alt="Ganong Pal-O-Mine Bar Candy District"></span></p>
<p><span>Since Arthur was such a chocolate </span><span>fanatic it was only fitting that he paired up with a man named George </span><span>Ensor and together with their chocolate loving sweet tooth's they </span><span>invented the fist ever wrapped chocolate bar, Pal-O-Mine. The year was 1920, and nothing like this </span><span>existed at the time. It quickly became a huge hit for chocolate l</span><span>over's everywhere! Talk about a genius idea! </span><span>The <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/pal-o-mine-bar" target="_blank" title="Pal-O-Mine Bar" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Pal-O-Mine Bar</strong></a> is still widely consumed today, an old </span><span>fashioned chocolate bar that we won't soon forget. It consists of a </span><span>rich fudge.coconut and peanut middle, that is then coated in Ganong's </span><span>finest dark chocolate. Arthur and George made a delicious, and most epic </span><span>collaboration!</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span>Ganong gave us the first Heart Shaped Chocolate Box</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/ganong-chocolates-candy-district-online-candy-store-canada.png?v=1499477425" alt="Ganong Chocolates-Candy District "></span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<br><span>Ganong was also the very first company to give us chocolates in heart </span><span>shaped boxes. A classic and romantic gift we all love. When first introduced in the 1930's, these heart shaped chocolate boxes were formed and decorated by hand at the St. Stephen location.</span>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span></span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span>Also, Ganong was the very first Canadian company to make lollipops by </span><span>using the wooden skewers of a butcher. Now that's clever!</span>
</div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span>Ganong Chicken Bones are a Canadian Christmas Tradition</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/ganong-chicken-bones-candy-district-online-candy-warehouse.png?v=1499476865" alt="Ganong Chicken Bones-Old Fashioned Candy"></p>
<p><br><span>Another very famous Canadian candy is also thanks to Ganong, <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/ganong-chicken-bones" target="_blank" title="Chicken Bones" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Chicken Bones</strong></a>! </span><span>Chicken Bones were invented in 1885, by a Ganong candy maker Frank Sparhak. </span><span>These glossy, hot pink candies are not only beautiful to look at but they </span><span>are certainly unique and tasty! The outside is a spicy cinnamon </span><span>flavored candy that is filled with a soft bittersweet chocolate. This </span><span>seems like an odd pairing at first, but when you taste them you'll have</span><br><span>nothing but thanks and love for Frank and his genius combination! Chicken Bones are a very well loved old fashion candy in Canada </span><span>Chicken Bones are highly </span><span>sought after, especially at Christmas. Without a dish of these Chicken </span><span>Bones, our Canadian Christmas gatherings would not be the same!</span></p>

About to get even sweeter as I unwrap my <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/tootsie-roll-candy-bars" target="_blank" title="Tootsie Rolls" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Tootsie Rolls</strong></a>...</span></div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span>The Original Penny Candy</span></h3>
<div>This old fashion candy all started with a very poor Austrian immigrant,a recipe for delicious candy, and of course a sweet dream! Tootsie Rolls were invented by Leo Hirschfeld. He must have got his sweet determination from his father who was also a  candy maker back home in Austria. Leo first sold Tootsie Rolls in his little shop in New York in 1896. He wrapped each candy by hand. The Tootsie Roll candy is said to be the very first penny candy that was ever sold! Over the years Tootsie Rolls gained immense popularity, and in 1917 Tootsie Rolls were in huge demand. <a href="http://www.tootsie.com/" target="_blank" title="Tootsie Roll Industries" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Tootsie Roll Industries</strong></a> has grown to be a huge candy empire and now produces some of our favourite candy brands including: <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/collections/charms-candy" target="_blank" title="Charms" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Charms</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/charleston-chew-chocolate" target="_blank" title="Charleston Chew" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Charleston Chew</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/nik-l-nip-5-bottles" target="_blank" title="Nik-L-Nip" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Nik-L-Nip</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/wack-o-wax-lips" target="_blank" title="Wack-O-Wax" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Wack-O-Wax</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/dubble-bubble-gum-tub" target="_blank" title="Dubble Bubble" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Dubble Bubble</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/sugar-daddy-caramel-pops" target="_blank" title="Sugar Daddy" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Sugar Daddy</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/razzles-original" target="_blank" title="Razzles" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Razzles</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/junior-mints-theater-pack" target="_blank" title="Junior Mints" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Junior Mints</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/cry-baby-assorted-gumballs" target="_blank" title="Cry Baby" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Cry Baby</strong></a> and so many more!</div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Tootsie Rolls named after a Sweetie</h3>
<div>I have always wondered about the name and finally learned where it came from. Apparently, Leo Hirschfeld had a sweet little daughter named Clara. It is said that his nick name for Clara was Tootsie, so Leo decided to name the Tootsie Roll candy after his daughter.</div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Summer Candy that won't melt in the sun</h3>
<div>Tootsie Rolls were thought of as being a great alternative to chocolate and they wouldn't melt in the sun, making them a good choice in hotter weather. Soldiers were given Tootsie Rolls in their rations making it easy for them to enjoy as they would not spoil. They were also a  quick pick me up for the soldiers. Tootsie Rolls were even an affordable candy during the Depression. The ingredients were not rationed and they were very inexpensive, so everyone could enjoy them.</div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Everyone Loves Tootsie Rolls!</h3>
<div>To this day Tootsie Rolls are a favorite of many candy lovers! There are over 64 million made everyday! Tootsie Rolls remain a staple in the candy world to this day. They are an old fashion candy that never goes out of style!</div>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/necco-wafers-americas-iconic-candy-old-fashioned-candies.png?v=1498713581" alt="NECCO Wafers-Old Fashioned Candy"></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"> NECCO Wafers are Old Fashioned Candy from 1847</h3>
<p>A sweet and classic old fashioned candy and delightfully delicious. A pack of NECCO Wafers are a perfect companion during National Candy Month. Easy to keep in your pocket and share with your best friend on a nice breezy summer's eve walk. <a href="http://www.necco.com/Candy/Wafers.aspx" target="_blank" title="NECCO Wafers" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>NECCO Wafers</strong></a> have been around since 1847. They were invented by Oliver Chase, who also came up with a special machine that could cut candy into lozenge like shapes. The wafers used to be called "hub wafers" before they were NECCO Wafers. It wasn't until 1901 that they became known as NECCO Wafers. NECCO stands for <a href="http://www.necco.com/" target="_blank" title="New England Confectionery Company" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>New England Confectionery Company</strong></a> and is the oldest candy company in the USA!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Soldiers wanted their NECCO Wafers!</h3>
<p>During World War two soldiers were given Necco Wafers for their rations, and NECCO says that this greatly increased the popularity of the candy. When all the soldiers returned home they wanted their Necco Wafers!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Candy Lovers wanted the original NECCO Wafers</h3>
<p>The original flavours in NECCO Wafers are Lemon, Lime, Orange, Clove, Cinnamon, Wintergreen, Licorice and Chocolate. This was all fine and dandy for the fans of NECCO Wafers until in 2009. NECCO decided to change the flavours into all natural colours and flavours. This proved to be a  complete fail for NECCO! Sales plummeted and in 2011, much to the relief of NECCO Wafer fans, the company went back to the original flavours! </p>
<p>NECCO Wafers are an old fashion candy, sweet and tasty, perfect for sharing!</p>
<p>Other iconic candies that NECCO makes are <strong>Sky Bar</strong>, <strong>Haviland Thin Mints</strong>, <strong>Slap Stix</strong>, <strong>Mary Jane</strong>, <strong>Mighty Malts</strong>, <strong>Clark Bar</strong>, <strong>Candy Buttons</strong>, <strong>Squirrel Nut Zippers</strong> and the awful <strong>Sweethearts</strong>!</p>

<div></div>
<div>If your the type who can't quite make up your mind, we've got just the dual purpose candy for you! Razzles! This retro candy first appeared in 1966, and as the slogan says "First it's a candy, then it's a gum. Little round Razzles are so much fun". Yes they are, Razzles are an intense, tangy and sweet candy that magically transforms into gum! Razzles are currently being made right here in Canada by <strong>Concord Confections</strong> which has been owned by the sweet geniuses at <a href="http://www.tootsie.com/" target="_blank" title="Tootsie Roll Industries" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Tootsie Roll Industries</strong></a> since 2004.</div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Razzles has a cool Retro Candy name</h3>
<div>Razzles first got their name due to the fact that they were going to be an exclusively raspberry flavored candy/gum. The name for this raspberry flavor was going to be "razzleberry" but the makers decided to use the real word raspberry instead, and played with the" razzleberry" word in their name. Hence the cool and funky name, Razzles!  For a few years Razzles were only available in raspberry flavoUrs, until they decided to expand into their other delicious fruity flavors.</div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Razzles are a fun retro candy experience</h3>
<div>The fact that these candies change into gum lets you experience a wide range of flavors and texture, which always earns extra points for a candy, especially if it works and tastes great, like Razzles do! How could any candy lover not appreciate this dual purpose candy? Razzles really are transformationial, and such a tasty treat! These little pretty candies, pack a punch with their tangy and sweet flavors.</div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">4 Sweet and Sour Flavours</h3>

<div></div>
<div>
<p>A childhood memory, a sweet bite of nostalgia on a stick, BB Bats are an essential old fashion candy for any candy lover! BB Bats were first introduced in 1924, in Johnson City, NY and are currently being made by the <a href="http://www.runkcandy.com/" target="_blank" title="Runk Candy Company" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Runk Candy Company</strong></a> in Cincinnati Ohio. These Taffy Suckers come in all the best flavours: Vanilla, Strawberry, Chocolate and Banana.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Fall in Love Again with BB Bats Taffy Suckers</strong></h3>
<p>Let yourself fall in love all over again with these delicious BB Bats. Also take pride in introducing them to the younger generation. Share with them your stories of the good old days gone by while indulging in this delightful old fashion candy!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Why are they called BB Bats?</strong></h3>
<p>Many people have wondered why they are called BB Bats, and I must confess upon hours of research I could not find any real explanation as to why these go by the name of BB Bats. My only conclusion is that perhaps they were enjoyed during all those fun Summer Baseball games, while you watched your friends play, or sat watching the game while enjoying your BB Bat. To say they were made to resemble a baseball bat, would be a far stretch, other then the fact that they are on a stick.</p>
<p>What ever the reason, we'll just have to ponder this question while eating copious amounts of this old fashion candy, BB Bats!</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Bubble Gum is Summertime Fun!</h3>
<div>Hubba Bubba is just the gum for those intense bubbles, not too sticky and a very long lasting flavour. Hubba Bubba is a cool retro gum that we've been chewing since 1979. </div>
<div>"Big bubbles, no troubles"! Hubba Bubba is a  gum that has always captivated us bubble blowers! Hubba Bubba delivers on this promise, the biggest bubbles I've ever blown were from this mouthwatering, delicious Hubba Bubba!</div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Hubba Bubba is Famous Around the World</h3>
<div>
<a href="http://www.wrigley.com/global/brands/hubba-bubba.aspx" target="_blank" title="Hubba Bubba Bubble Gum" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Hubba Bubba Bubbble Gum</strong></a> is a very well recognized brand across the world, especially popular in Canada, Australia, Germany and the UK. There is some debate over the name Hubba Bubba. They say that soldiers from World War Two used the term "Hubba Hubba" to express approval. Another theory is that the word comes from the German word "Hubsche'', which translated into English means beautiful. I would assume that the word Bubba is meant to refer to bubbles. So maybe the gum really means Beautiful Bubbles! Who knows the exact history or meaning of the name, we just know that Hubba Bubba is a cool name and it means delicious, retro bubble gum and has the best potential for blowing huge, enormous bubbles!</div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Hubba Bubba came back in 2004</h3>
<div>Much to the dismay of its fans, in the later years of the 1980s, Hubba Bubba was discontinued with no real explanation as to why. No worries though, Hubba Bubba came back to the world with it's sweet, delicious vengeance in 2004. Also with some brand new flavours.</div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Hubba Bubba comes in many fun flavours</h3>
<div>The most sought after and popular flavour of Hubba Bubba is the Original, but there is also Strawberry Crush, Grape Crush, Strawberry Watermelon, and Sour Blue Raspberry. quite a tasty selection! All of Hubba Bubba's flavours are very long lasting, and will not stick to your face after the huge bubbles you have blown,</div>
<div>pop! No troubles, with this Bubble Gum!   </div>

<div>Many people say that the allure of Bonomo Turkish Taffy is how long the flavour lasts.

Bonomo Turkish Taffy was also marketed as being an interactive </div>
<div>candy. "Crack It Up" as the label says, is like an invitation to play with your food. A six year old would find this fascinating and a Baby Boomer would fondly remember his childhood.</div>

<div>"Have a break, have a Kit Kat"! So go ahead and get snappy this summer, with a Kit Kat Chocolate Bar! With it's light and crispy wafers that are coated in a smooth milk chocolate, Kit Kat Chocolate Bars are a light and refreshing snack, just perfect for June! They are not at all heavy, and the fingers of four that you are meant to break apart, just don't seem enough some times. Even though Kit Kat highly recommends sharing, I doubt that most of us do, they are just gone so darn fast! The snap sound of breaking a Kit Kat chocolate bar apart, even sounds delicious!</div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Old Fashioned Candy Bar from 1935</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/kit-kat-chocolate-bars-nestle-old-fashioned-candy-national-candy-month-candydistrict.png?v=1498159175" alt="Kit Kat Old Fashioned Candy"></strong></p>
<div>Kit Kat Chocolate Bars were first introduced in 1935 By Rowntrees and are currently made by <a href="https://www.madewithnestle.ca/complementary-brands" target="_blank" title="Nestle" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Nestle</strong></a> in Canada. They quickly became a highly sought after Chocolate Bar. Besides Kit Kat's most current slogans, they also had some older ones like "the biggest little meal" and also "the best companion to a cup of tea". What ever the slogan, Kit Kat's are always a reliable source of sweetness and satisfaction! </div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Kit Kat is a huge brand in Japan</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0736/7879/files/kit-kat-japanese-candy-nestle-national-candy-month-candy-district.png?v=1498158640" alt="Japanese Kit Kat Chocolate Bars-National Candy Month"></p>
<div>Kit Kat has also recently became a huge brand in Japan. They have released over 300 different variations of the bar. Some weird and wacky flavours include: Azuki Bean, Grilled Potato, Cherry Blossom, Edamame Soybean, Hojicha Roasted Tea, Wasabi... just to name a few. I think I would probably shy away from these flavours. Call me boring but I love the original old fashion Kit Kat!</div>

<div>
<br>
<div>An Old Fashion Candy that's an ideal summer candy! Truly a classic choice for candy lovers. <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/maynards-wine-gums" target="_blank" title="Maynards Wine Gums" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Maynards Wine Gums</strong></a> have been around since 1909 and are made in Toronto. Wine Gums are ideal in their texture. They are chewy but never too sticky or stretchy. Maynards Wine Gums are a sophisticated candy. So very tasty with all their fine and distinctive flavors.</div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Have a Wine Gum instead of wine</h3>
<div>Despite their name, Wine Gums contain no wine in them and were actually meant to persuade people to eat the candy instead of drinking alcoholic beverages. Well, Wine Gums are delightfully delicious and could easily be savored to the likes of a "fine wine'.</div>
<div>The flavors in Maynards Wine Gums are not overly sweet, and they have a certain level of tartness to them, but not sour. The original flavors of Wine Gums include: Raspberry (red) lemon (yellow) orange (orange) lime(green) black current(black) and grapefruit(white).</div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">What your favourite Wine Gum flavour?</h3>
<div>Every flavor of<a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/maynards-wine-gums-roll" target="_blank" title="Maynards Wine Gums" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong> Maynards Wine Gums</strong></a> are utterly fantastic. They say the flavor that most people love the best are the black ones, which are the black current flavor. I must admit, they are my favorite Wine Gum flavor! Maynards Wine Gums seem to pull you in with their smooth and intense fruity flavors. They do have an addictive quality to them. One roll is never enough, but to be honest neither is one bag!</div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Sour Wine Gums</h3>
<div>Maynards Candy also have a sour version of Wine Gums that are every bit as tasty as the original Wine Gums but leave you with a more intense tartness and tangy feeling.  <a href="https://www.candydistrict.com/products/maynards-sour-wine-gums" target="_blank" title="Maynards Sour Wine Gums" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Maynards Sour Wine Gums</strong></a> start off on a sour note, but then reel you back in with their usual sweetness</div>
<div></div>
<div>Maynards Wine Gums are a retro candy that seem to acquire more fans everyday. Put down your glass of Cabernet Sauvigon and reach for your Wine Gums instead!</div>
